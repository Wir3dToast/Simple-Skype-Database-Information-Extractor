[ 2013-08-27 03:26:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Skype is peculiar sometimes.

[ 2013-08-27 03:35:21 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah
[ 2013-08-27 03:35:35 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | shitton of packet loss
[ 2013-08-27 03:35:49 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | 2% loss
[ 2013-08-27 03:36:00 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that's 1911 packages out of 64019
[ 2013-08-27 03:36:06 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | not as bad as it sounds but
[ 2013-08-27 03:36:14 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i mean it sounds not so bad but
[ 2013-08-27 03:36:24 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it loses the packages all at once so
[ 2013-08-27 03:36:28 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it really sucks dick
[ 2013-08-27 03:37:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | If only I could share my connection with you guys.
[ 2013-08-27 03:38:53 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | By the way, and I'm sure you remember this, JT is wrong about the relationship between Kirito and Suguha.
[ 2013-08-27 03:42:47 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah man it's fucking incest
[ 2013-08-27 03:43:08 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ...What is JT's view of incest then?...
[ 2013-08-27 03:43:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Is he alright, man? Lol.
[ 2013-08-27 03:45:14 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-27 03:45:20 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | jt just doesn't want to admit it
[ 2013-08-27 00:54:51 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | josh is huehuehue
[ 2013-08-27 00:54:59 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | jalen is &quot;TheBasedOne&quot;
[ 2013-08-27 03:50:51 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | they are cousins, they can get married
[ 2013-08-27 03:51:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Even so, she calls him &quot;brother.&quot; Even if they don't possess the same father and mother, the implications of this are quite disturbing to many societies around the world.
[ 2013-08-27 03:51:59 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm not sure the connotation of that term &quot;onii-chan&quot;
[ 2013-08-27 03:52:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | This is definitely a mainstream anime, and I think many people would flinch badly at this.
[ 2013-08-27 03:52:18 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it could mean other things besides &quot;brother&quot; in their culture, like &quot;esteemed elder male&quot;
[ 2013-08-27 03:52:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Suguha's mother explained the back story of it.
[ 2013-08-27 03:52:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Suguha knows at least.
[ 2013-08-27 03:52:41 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well yes they thought they were brother and sister
[ 2013-08-27 03:52:57 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but the term could be the same regardless of their relationship
[ 2013-08-27 03:53:17 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm not sure though
[ 2013-08-27 03:53:20 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i still think it's weird but
[ 2013-08-27 03:53:42 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i usually wouldn't aim for people even remotely related to me
[ 2013-08-27 03:54:22 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | marrying cousins is not taboo in japan &gt;.&gt;
[ 2013-08-27 03:54:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Third cousins are acceptable because I think most Americans have accepted it.

[ 2013-08-27 18:51:36 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | hi
[ 2013-08-27 20:17:22 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | psst edward
[ 2013-08-27 20:17:27 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | psssssssssssst
[ 2013-08-27 20:17:35 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | wat
[ 2013-08-27 20:18:31 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so i want to make a top section of the site separated from the rest of it by a small line and in that top section there is the title of the site along with a row of small pictures that when you click on them lead you to the other sections of the site
[ 2013-08-27 20:19:03 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Ok.. sounds good.
[ 2013-08-27 20:19:47 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-27 20:20:10 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | is there a way to do that using css? so that it applies it to every page of the site?
[ 2013-08-27 20:20:21 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | or do i need to copypaste the html for each page
[ 2013-08-27 20:21:44 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I mean you can just make a CSS style sheet and import it into every page you make
[ 2013-08-27 20:23:38 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | right i'm using a css style sheet now, i just don't know how to make the image thing apply to every one. is it just like a regular html thing and i can put a &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; section to make edits to the body of every document?
[ 2013-08-27 20:26:57 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | right so you can make a CSS file called &quot;style.css&quot; and you can import into your html file by &lt;link href=&quot;style.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
[ 2013-08-27 20:27:13 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i know i have that already
[ 2013-08-27 20:27:35 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | then what is the problem?
[ 2013-08-27 20:27:59 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well so far the only things this tutorial has told me i can do is change stuff like background and stuff
[ 2013-08-27 20:28:38 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | if i make a &lt;body&gt; section in the css document, will it make edits to the body section in the html docs it refers to?
[ 2013-08-27 20:28:51 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yes
[ 2013-08-27 20:28:55 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It should

[ 2013-08-27 23:33:33 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I can't concentrate in my room
[ 2013-08-27 23:33:52 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | just live in the library

[ 2013-08-27 23:34:53 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Actually, maybe it's b/c I want to go outside
[ 2013-08-27 23:34:59 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but there is nothing to do outside
[ 2013-08-27 23:35:18 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | go jogging
[ 2013-08-27 23:35:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | You're at Berkeley already, correct?
[ 2013-08-27 23:35:32 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yep
[ 2013-08-27 23:35:43 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Jalen, you would love it here
[ 2013-08-27 23:35:46 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | fuck 3 hour difference
[ 2013-08-27 23:35:50 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's so fucking liberal
[ 2013-08-27 23:35:54 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | no joke
[ 2013-08-27 23:36:03 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I have never seen a society so loose
[ 2013-08-27 23:36:20 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I love it
[ 2013-08-27 23:36:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Nice. I wish I was. Right now, I'm trying to see if I can rearrange my schedule around a bit.
[ 2013-08-27 23:36:59 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah.. but I'm so lonely
[ 2013-08-27 23:37:07 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I need a fucking job.
[ 2013-08-27 23:37:21 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | or I need classes to start
[ 2013-08-27 23:37:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Why are you not going out to meet people? I know that's a hypocritical thing to ask, but I take it the people there are much better than over here.
[ 2013-08-27 23:37:50 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It really isn't
[ 2013-08-27 23:38:08 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | People here are preppier than South Carolina's people will ever be
[ 2013-08-27 23:38:32 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'd find that to be worse.
[ 2013-08-27 23:38:46 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's pretty much a party school here
[ 2013-08-27 23:38:56 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | people were slamming doors at 1 this morning
[ 2013-08-27 23:39:14 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | So girl said &quot;you wanna get fucked&quot; to some other person last night
[ 2013-08-27 23:39:18 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that was fun
[ 2013-08-27 23:39:40 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | oh yeah, the dorms are smaller than G school's
[ 2013-08-27 23:39:43 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and we have a hall bathroom
[ 2013-08-27 23:39:50 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | which is gender inexclusive btw
[ 2013-08-27 23:41:48 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | FUCK YEA BERKELEY
[ 2013-08-27 23:41:51 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I WANT TO GO THERE!
[ 2013-08-27 23:41:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | What? Okay, I won't complain about my own housing at USC (not that I did that anyway).
[ 2013-08-27 23:41:55 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | HOLY SHIT
[ 2013-08-27 23:42:13 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah, at least they have a lot of hot korean girls here
[ 2013-08-27 23:42:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I don't like the idea of a hall bathroom. I had to do that for six weeks for Duke TIP. I didn't like it.
[ 2013-08-27 23:42:27 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I was THIS close to joining the christian korean group
[ 2013-08-27 23:42:37 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | b/c of beautiful women
[ 2013-08-27 23:43:08 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Actually, i'm still debating it
[ 2013-08-27 23:43:16 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | do it edward
[ 2013-08-27 23:43:40 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah, then I saw their boyfriends and I was like
[ 2013-08-27 23:43:47 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | fuck that I can't compete with that
[ 2013-08-27 23:43:52 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-27 23:43:53 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so.. I gave up
[ 2013-08-27 23:43:58 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | don't ever give up
[ 2013-08-27 23:44:08 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | hold on brb going to opensuse
[ 2013-08-27 23:44:23 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | But yeah Jalen, the campus is beautiful
[ 2013-08-27 23:44:32 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and the people are really unique and active here
[ 2013-08-27 23:44:59 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | There is going to be a big socialist gathering soon actually
[ 2013-08-27 23:46:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Oh, yeah, about joining a club with mostly girls: don't do it in most cases.
[ 2013-08-27 23:46:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | At least, from my own personal experience, it means nothing.
[ 2013-08-27 23:46:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I can see it as an easier way to get friend zoned.
[ 2013-08-27 23:46:51 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah, well, I really don't feel like talking to people here
[ 2013-08-27 23:47:02 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so I think I'm screwed socially.
[ 2013-08-27 23:47:12 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Well, here is to another shitty year.
[ 2013-08-27 23:47:26 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | don't give up edward!
[ 2013-08-27 23:47:31 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | you can have a great social life!
[ 2013-08-27 23:47:37 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | At least its better than SC
[ 2013-08-27 23:47:41 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so much things to do
[ 2013-08-27 23:47:44 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | join the quidditch team!

[ 2013-08-27 23:48:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That's the point, Edward. Why would you not make friends with people who are superior to those over here?
[ 2013-08-27 23:48:19 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | quidditch is for manly men
[ 2013-08-27 23:48:45 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Well, there are alot of retards here
[ 2013-08-27 23:48:53 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so....
[ 2013-08-27 23:48:56 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Ironic.
[ 2013-08-27 23:48:56 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Its difficult
[ 2013-08-27 23:49:18 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's those preppy people that dominate my hall
[ 2013-08-27 23:50:19 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | preppy people are fun!
[ 2013-08-27 23:50:56 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | nope lol
[ 2013-08-27 23:51:45 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Well, I talk to my roommate
[ 2013-08-27 23:51:57 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but... that's pretty much it.
[ 2013-08-27 23:52:02 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | He's pretty cool
[ 2013-08-27 23:52:12 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | He came from Sacramento
[ 2013-08-27 23:52:19 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Biochemistry major.
[ 2013-08-27 23:53:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Preppy people are fun?
[ 2013-08-27 23:53:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Whatever floats your boat, JT.
[ 2013-08-27 23:54:01 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That's why I kind of want a job
[ 2013-08-27 23:54:03 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so I can meet people
[ 2013-08-27 23:54:09 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but my dad is like fuck that
[ 2013-08-27 23:54:11 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | you can't get one
[ 2013-08-27 23:54:32 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | My counselor believes that if I were able to find a job, I could trust people more.
[ 2013-08-27 23:54:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I think he's right, but at the same time, I don't want to risk my grades.
[ 2013-08-27 23:54:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Not to mention, I'm too stubborn to settle most jobs here.
[ 2013-08-27 23:55:06 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | jalen
[ 2013-08-27 23:55:09 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | don't make me punch you
[ 2013-08-27 23:57:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | For what?
[ 2013-08-27 23:57:22 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | everything that isn't and everything that will be
[ 2013-08-27 23:57:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I don't see why you feel the need to punch me for it.
[ 2013-08-27 23:57:46 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Watch yourself.
[ 2013-08-27 23:57:57 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm always watching
[ 2013-08-27 23:58:03 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lurking in the shadows
[ 2013-08-27 23:58:13 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | getting ready to EXPLODE!
[ 2013-08-27 23:58:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Sigh, I can't change my schedule even if I wanted to, which I do.
[ 2013-08-27 23:58:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | The only negative of it really is that I'm going to be scramblinb for lunch Tuesday and Thursday.
[ 2013-08-28 00:01:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm sure that because of how liberal UC Berkeley is that they'll be more opportunities for you over there than here, Edward.
[ 2013-08-28 00:02:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | And while there might be a lot of preppy people, I'd say that the nerd and geek population is higher than ours.
[ 2013-08-28 00:14:32 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | 48$
[ 2013-08-28 00:14:40 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | should i do it&gt;

[ 2013-08-28 00:18:36 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | &gt;.&gt;
[ 2013-08-28 00:18:47 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I will become the best computer scientist this world has seen
[ 2013-08-28 00:19:01 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | You can count on that. I'm extremely serious about this now
[ 2013-08-28 00:19:21 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | unless you get into an accident
[ 2013-08-28 00:19:25 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I won't

[ 2013-08-28 00:19:53 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | They are all idiots anyway
[ 2013-08-28 00:20:30 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | edward you are mistaken
[ 2013-08-28 00:20:39 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | This is quite the predicament here.
[ 2013-08-28 00:20:45 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it is i who will be the best computer scientist ever
[ 2013-08-28 00:20:47 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I suppose this means we won't see you for a while.
[ 2013-08-28 00:20:59 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Challenge me in math Jt
[ 2013-08-28 00:21:08 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol fuck that
[ 2013-08-28 00:21:09 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and we shall see who does better in comp sci
[ 2013-08-28 00:22:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | JT, Edward is definitely better at math than you are. I'm going by classes the two of you took at Governor's School.
[ 2013-08-28 00:22:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That would already make him superior to you.
[ 2013-08-28 00:22:47 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Not to mention, he's already been coding and is more familiar with Linux.
[ 2013-08-28 00:22:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Even I can see that.
[ 2013-08-28 00:22:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | You're already playing catch up to him.
[ 2013-08-28 00:23:01 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that is the past jalen
[ 2013-08-28 00:23:08 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | my sights are on the future
[ 2013-08-28 00:25:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Edward's future is already more brightly lit than yours. No offense.
[ 2013-08-28 00:25:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm not saying you can't beat him, but you probably are behind at this point.
[ 2013-08-28 00:25:48 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Edward, what is your course of action for the next four years then?
[ 2013-08-28 00:27:44 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | First off, I want to apologize to you all. I have calmed down. I'm sorry if I offended anyone.
[ 2013-08-28 00:28:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Not at all.
[ 2013-08-28 00:28:03 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | oh i didn't notice
[ 2013-08-28 00:28:11 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I doubt I will become the best computer scientist, but I am really fking serious abou this
[ 2013-08-28 00:28:19 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | My dad has crossed the limit
[ 2013-08-28 00:28:44 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm fking tired of him saying &quot;Stop being lazy this&quot; or whatever the fuck he says
[ 2013-08-28 00:28:59 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | So I am going to make all A's this semester
[ 2013-08-28 00:29:11 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | If it is easy, then I will still have time to talk
[ 2013-08-28 00:29:33 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but if it is hard, I am probably not going to be on very often.
[ 2013-08-28 00:29:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Alright. That sounds good to me.
[ 2013-08-28 00:30:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'll miss you, but I know that it's more than necessary.
[ 2013-08-28 00:30:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Everything's everything.
[ 2013-08-28 00:31:17 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah, I'm going to teach that fucker a lesson
[ 2013-08-28 00:31:23 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | We shall see who has the last laugh
[ 2013-08-28 00:32:13 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It bites that even now your parents aren't willing to see the good in your just going to UCB.
[ 2013-08-28 00:32:28 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | they are asians
[ 2013-08-28 00:32:44 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it is never good enough
[ 2013-08-28 00:33:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Actually, I use to know an Asian girl who was terrible at math.
[ 2013-08-28 00:33:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | She was more American than Asian, and I'm sure her parents were the same way.
[ 2013-08-28 00:33:32 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I found it out that my grades were that much higher than hers while we were in IB.
[ 2013-08-28 00:34:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | She wouldn't flinch at Bs, which is still excellent for a white, black, or latino American.
[ 2013-08-28 00:36:11 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i never cared about my grades lol
[ 2013-08-28 00:40:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | When is the last day we should be expecting you, Edward?
[ 2013-08-28 00:40:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Sunday? I assume that once your schoolweek starts is when it happens.
[ 2013-08-28 00:40:50 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Well... Let's just see how my classes go first
[ 2013-08-28 00:40:58 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | If they are relatively easy, then there is no last day
[ 2013-08-28 00:41:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Relatively, eh?
[ 2013-08-28 00:41:37 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I hope they are
[ 2013-08-28 00:42:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | My lows~...
[ 2013-08-28 00:45:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Gettin' high to disguise my lows~
[ 2013-08-28 00:47:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | At least try to make new friends, Edward (unlike me).
[ 2013-08-28 00:49:14 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I will try.
[ 2013-08-28 00:49:32 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | make friends who have cars
[ 2013-08-28 00:49:53 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | jalen do you know what josh is doing?
[ 2013-08-28 00:50:14 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I think he still has class.
[ 2013-08-28 00:51:04 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | did he talk to you about staying over? he might stay the night at his brothers.  cause it is pretty late
[ 2013-08-28 00:51:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | No, he didn't saying anything to me.
[ 2013-08-28 00:52:02 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | alrighty
[ 2013-08-28 00:52:24 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | because i thought his class ended around 8:20
[ 2013-08-28 00:52:33 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | wait
[ 2013-08-28 00:52:48 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | nvm 8:45
[ 2013-08-28 00:53:13 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | since it is a t/th class and those classes are usually 1h15m long
[ 2013-08-28 00:55:59 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | nvm josh is here
[ 2013-08-28 00:56:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I just finished SAO.
[ 2013-08-28 00:57:08 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Hey, Josh.
[ 2013-08-28 00:58:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I've decided to give the anime a 7.
[ 2013-08-28 00:58:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | There's a lot of promise for this remake.
[ 2013-08-28 00:58:35 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | HI GUYS
[ 2013-08-28 00:58:37 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | IM A LIVER
[ 2013-08-28 00:58:40 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i lived
[ 2013-08-28 00:58:43 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | on the way back to class
[ 2013-08-28 00:58:47 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | from class
[ 2013-08-28 00:58:48 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | *
[ 2013-08-28 00:58:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I haven't felt this attached to a an anime I've given a 7 since Angel Beats.
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Nani?
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:04 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but angel beats was so good
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:14 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i had to walk past an abandoned warehouse with crack dealers and rednecks
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:20 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it was awesome
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It was, but it was quite flawed.
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Oh no.
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:30 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | a lot of animes are flawed
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm glad you are okay.
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:33 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | thanks
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:34 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | <ss type="laugh">:D</ss>
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That one especially. I loved it, but it was too short.
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:43 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | steins; gate was flawless
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:45 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | angel beats was just too short and had shitty character development
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:53 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that's why im gonna cosplay as okarin, jt
[ 2013-08-28 00:59:54 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Not to mention, the manga does a better job with the plot than the anime.
[ 2013-08-28 01:00:07 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ah
[ 2013-08-28 01:00:31 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well how long is the manga
[ 2013-08-28 01:00:53 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I don't know, but Edward can explain.
[ 2013-08-28 01:00:57 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Oh
[ 2013-08-28 01:00:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Better than I can.
[ 2013-08-28 01:01:07 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Actually the manga sucked
[ 2013-08-28 01:01:13 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-28 01:01:19 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It was one of the worst magna series I have ever read
[ 2013-08-28 01:01:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | No~~~
[ 2013-08-28 01:01:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Accursed author(s) and/or producer(s).
[ 2013-08-28 01:01:50 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | &gt;.&gt;
[ 2013-08-28 01:02:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It has so much potential. To be captivating even with the bad plot and character development is remarkable.
[ 2013-08-28 01:02:55 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I want to see the author strive to improve this.
[ 2013-08-28 01:04:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'll be back after my shower, guys.
[ 2013-08-28 01:04:19 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah, I'm getting off for now as well
[ 2013-08-28 01:04:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | See you later then.
[ 2013-08-28 01:04:36 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | there are rumors for a visual novel
[ 2013-08-28 01:04:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Sweet. I'll be back, man.
[ 2013-08-28 01:04:55 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | k
[ 2013-08-28 01:30:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm back.
[ 2013-08-28 01:39:53 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | What are you cooking?
[ 2013-08-28 01:39:39 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm cooking
[ 2013-08-28 01:41:39 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | he's cooking shitty vegetarian fried rice
[ 2013-08-28 01:41:53 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm being lazy and just put popcorn chicken in the oven
[ 2013-08-28 01:42:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Both of those sound tasty regardless.
[ 2013-08-28 01:43:23 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | On an unrelated note, is anyone else questioning all of these general education courses we have to take?
[ 2013-08-28 01:43:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I feel like I'm giving the university unnecessary money because of these classes.
[ 2013-08-28 01:50:24 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol yeah
[ 2013-08-28 01:50:25 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | uni is a scam
[ 2013-08-28 01:50:35 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and textbooks are too
[ 2013-08-28 01:51:10 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I have to take 80 hours worth of general education courses...
[ 2013-08-28 01:55:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3SyhT1Gl38&amp;feature=youtube_video_deck">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3SyhT1Gl38&amp;feature=youtube_video_deck</a>
[ 2013-08-28 01:55:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That top comment.
[ 2013-08-28 01:55:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That is all. You don't have to watch the video if you don't want to.
[ 2013-08-28 02:00:43 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-28 02:02:10 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'd want a lady who likes that personally.
[ 2013-08-28 02:04:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That would make taking this general education courses more bearable I think.
[ 2013-08-28 02:16:51 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm back
[ 2013-08-28 02:16:55 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | the rice was ok
[ 2013-08-28 02:17:02 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i added wasabi to it
[ 2013-08-28 02:17:32 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Nice. You're doing well with your added independence.
[ 2013-08-28 02:18:15 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yea, i don't have the materials to make good rice
[ 2013-08-28 02:18:32 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that and this is my second time cooking it
[ 2013-08-28 02:19:54 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | he doesn't have butter
[ 2013-08-28 02:19:56 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | or enough eggs
[ 2013-08-28 02:20:07 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | he also doesn't have mayonnaise
[ 2013-08-28 02:20:08 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm sorry i only had 3 eggs left
[ 2013-08-28 02:20:13 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | or tomato sauce
[ 2013-08-28 02:20:17 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | or cayenne pepper
[ 2013-08-28 02:20:22 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | or sugar
[ 2013-08-28 02:20:50 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | basically he dumped rice in a pan and put an egg in with it and then dumped a shitton of soy sauce on it and stirred it up
[ 2013-08-28 02:21:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'd still eat it every now and then.
[ 2013-08-28 02:21:49 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that's how those habachi people do it
[ 2013-08-28 02:21:50 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-28 02:22:20 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | True, and I find that to be good at least.
[ 2013-08-28 02:22:26 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i wanna make rice next time
[ 2013-08-28 02:22:37 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but im probably gonna wait till i get the right materials
[ 2013-08-28 02:23:07 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol or go buy them tomorrow
[ 2013-08-28 02:24:31 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | jalen i bought the book 48$

[ 2013-08-28 02:31:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Oh, yeah, it is according to the bulletin.
[ 2013-08-28 02:31:33 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | bmen people don't talk to people
[ 2013-08-28 02:32:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | You two need to learn how to write better than them as well, unless they also have to take business or technical writing.
[ 2013-08-28 02:34:05 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well first i need to learn how to communicate
[ 2013-08-28 02:36:39 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm surprised you guys are limited to just one speech class. I can choose between three.
[ 2013-08-28 02:40:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I don't understand why my statistics course has a lab.
[ 2013-08-28 02:40:47 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Weird.
[ 2013-08-28 02:41:16 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i dont understand why my understaning other cultures class has a lab
[ 2013-08-28 02:41:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Nani!? What class is this?
[ 2013-08-28 02:42:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | My class is specifically STAT 201. I looked up the course you guys have to take, which is STAT 509, and you guys don't require a lab.
[ 2013-08-28 02:42:56 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Understanding Other Cultures? Is this Anthropology?
[ 2013-08-28 02:43:03 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yep
[ 2013-08-28 02:43:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Oh, yeah, Anthropology is considered to be science.
[ 2013-08-28 02:43:46 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's a mix of social science and natural science.
[ 2013-08-28 02:43:57 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it is understanding societies and stuuf
[ 2013-08-28 02:44:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I have no idea what kind of lab you would do for a class like that.
[ 2013-08-28 02:44:21 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | me either
[ 2013-08-28 02:44:22 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-28 02:45:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I don't expect an archealogical aspect of that major until 300 or 400 level.
[ 2013-08-28 02:45:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That would definitely explain the need for a lab.
[ 2013-08-28 02:46:33 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'll tell you what we are doing friday
[ 2013-08-28 02:46:33 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-28 02:47:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | A Friday lab?

[ 2013-08-28 02:51:44 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | for this gaming job
[ 2013-08-28 02:52:15 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i have to learn how to communicate. Then right reviews. Potentially do some blogging

[ 2013-08-28 02:54:58 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | or apply to positions for smaller companies
[ 2013-08-28 02:56:08 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | then those companies will tell me what i'm going to get paid
[ 2013-08-28 02:58:31 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | essentially what i'm doing is looking for a full time job

[ 2013-08-28 03:01:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Sweet. Now if only I could find some freelance work.
[ 2013-08-28 03:01:38 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-28 03:01:49 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i have to design a game
[ 2013-08-28 03:03:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ...I couldn't do that.

[ 2013-08-28 03:04:29 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm going to make a crazy game
[ 2013-08-28 03:04:36 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that requires 2 mice
[ 2013-08-28 03:09:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | If you say so. Lol.
[ 2013-08-28 03:09:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm going to head off to bed soon.
[ 2013-08-28 03:09:55 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | alrighty
[ 2013-08-28 03:09:59 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i might do that too
[ 2013-08-28 03:10:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Alright. Good night then. Tell Josh I said good night as well.

[ 2013-08-28 03:12:37 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I was wondering why is Jalen going to bed so early
[ 2013-08-28 03:12:46 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | then I realized the time difference
[ 2013-08-28 03:12:53 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | holy shit an invisible edward
[ 2013-08-28 03:13:03 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ikr.. fking scary ghost man

[ 2013-08-28 03:13:44 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so edward if your semester isy pretty eas
[ 2013-08-28 03:13:46 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | easy
[ 2013-08-28 03:13:53 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | we should design a game
[ 2013-08-28 03:14:06 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | hori shet
[ 2013-08-28 03:14:09 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | an edward
[ 2013-08-28 03:15:01 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | K.. what engine?
[ 2013-08-28 03:15:10 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Holy shit an edward. Who the fuck is that?
[ 2013-08-28 03:15:15 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | probably unity since it is free
[ 2013-08-28 03:15:25 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Lol.. my research used unity
[ 2013-08-28 03:16:00 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | fantastic so you have some knoweledge about it
[ 2013-08-28 03:16:23 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah.. a bit
[ 2013-08-28 03:16:34 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | why do you want to make a game?
[ 2013-08-28 03:16:41 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | put it on my resume
[ 2013-08-28 03:16:43 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-28 03:16:46 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Oh i see
[ 2013-08-28 03:16:51 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | k
[ 2013-08-28 03:18:44 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | What kind of game?
[ 2013-08-28 03:19:05 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | action rpg
[ 2013-08-28 03:20:29 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | an rpg. That is a lot of work
[ 2013-08-28 03:20:43 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yes
[ 2013-08-28 03:20:49 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but it will be worth it in the end
[ 2013-08-28 03:21:03 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | then we might be able to publish it somewhere in like 2-3 years lol
[ 2013-08-28 03:22:31 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Maybe
[ 2013-08-28 03:23:38 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yea, lol but if we do publish a game, our resumes will be godlike compared to other people looking for jobs
[ 2013-08-28 03:24:58 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Right. If we do publish it that is
[ 2013-08-28 03:25:06 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yea
[ 2013-08-28 03:25:07 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | if not
[ 2013-08-28 03:25:21 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | we can still say we designed a game
[ 2013-08-28 03:28:43 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah. It's tempting
[ 2013-08-28 03:29:06 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | We shall see if my schedule allows it though
[ 2013-08-28 03:29:18 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yea
[ 2013-08-28 03:29:59 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | if not we could work on it like on breaks and such
[ 2013-08-28 03:31:54 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | we could just make a platformer
[ 2013-08-28 03:32:01 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | instead of going all out and making an rpg on the first time
[ 2013-08-28 03:33:47 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Probably easier
[ 2013-08-28 03:33:59 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | actually, it is easier
[ 2013-08-28 03:34:18 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah it is lol
[ 2013-08-28 03:34:28 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | probably one of the easiest genres to make
[ 2013-08-28 03:34:28 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | never
[ 2013-08-28 03:34:32 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | too easy
[ 2013-08-28 03:34:35 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | besides maybe just a regular final fantasy style rpg
[ 2013-08-28 03:36:14 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | josh's lil bro can do the music
[ 2013-08-28 03:36:39 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ok so edward
[ 2013-08-28 03:36:44 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ignoring jt's stupidity
[ 2013-08-28 03:36:47 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | which do you think would be better
[ 2013-08-28 03:36:47 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Lol
[ 2013-08-28 03:36:51 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | an rpg or a platformer
[ 2013-08-28 03:37:01 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Well.. in terms of workload
[ 2013-08-28 03:37:09 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Platformer is the way to go
[ 2013-08-28 03:37:15 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | they're both decently easy in terms of workload
[ 2013-08-28 03:37:32 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | we can make an rpg as easy or hard as we want
[ 2013-08-28 03:37:46 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but what really matters is
[ 2013-08-28 03:37:50 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | what do we want to make
[ 2013-08-28 03:39:03 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Idk.. Platformer would probably be my choice
[ 2013-08-28 03:39:30 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | alrighty
[ 2013-08-28 03:39:37 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | we could do that
[ 2013-08-28 03:39:43 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | we have to make it super hard then
[ 2013-08-28 03:39:48 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | requires 2 mice to move
[ 2013-08-28 03:39:55 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | wtf lol
[ 2013-08-28 03:40:36 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Wat

[ 2013-08-28 03:41:18 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it is always my dream to create a game that requires two mice to play
[ 2013-08-28 03:41:50 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | then nobody would play it
[ 2013-08-28 03:41:58 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | pussies

[ 2013-08-28 18:03:24 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | tyler this is my anthopology assignment
[ 2013-08-28 18:03:25 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | This exercise helps you understand and reflect upon the often unspoken “rules” of local American cultural practices.  During this exercise, you will break a cultural rule in what you say/do and you will record people's reaction(s) to your rule breaking.  Examples might include: standing in an elevator with your back to the door (facing those on
the elevator), paying extra for something at the store and asking the clerk to accept the &quot;tip&quot; because they provided good service, or greeting someone with an &quot;air kiss&quot; on the cheek (as is done in France or the Dominican Republic, for example).
 
In doing this exercise, DO NOT BREAK ANY LAWS.  DO NOT PUT ANYONE (INCLUDING YOURSELF) IN ANY KIND OF DANGER.  DO NOT PUT YOURSELF OR ANYONE ELSE IN HARM'S WAY.  USE GOOD JUDGMENT.
 
Decide on what rule you'll break and write several sentences explaining it.
Describe the context in which you'll break it (an elevator, a store, etc.).
Explain why it is considered rule breaking.
Describe what happened when you broke the rule.  What were peoples'
reactions?  Note their body language and verbal responses.
After breaking the rule, explain to your audience/victim why you broke the rule.  What did they think/feel as you broke the rule?  Ask them.  Write several sentences this.
Finally, write a conclusion that sums up what you learned.  Were there any
surprises?  How did you feel conducting a mini-ethnography?
Papers should be no more than 1 1/2 pages in length (typed in 12 pt font)

[ 2013-08-28 22:39:26 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | then use my newfound power to rule the world
[ 2013-08-28 22:39:28 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | with my wife
[ 2013-08-28 22:40:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Honestly, Tyler, I think you should be the Based noe. Something tells me that once Based God or whoever this guy is sees you, he will have to redefine Basedness in your honor.
[ 2013-08-28 22:41:06 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol.  i don't think so, tim.
[ 2013-08-28 22:41:14 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I do think so, Tim.
[ 2013-08-28 22:41:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | As you have told me, women are not possessions.
[ 2013-08-28 22:41:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Your vision of that is much stronger than anyone I know.
[ 2013-08-28 22:41:52 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | my vision is bad
[ 2013-08-28 22:41:54 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i need glasses
[ 2013-08-28 22:42:14 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | If your vision is bad, mine is even worse than I thought...
[ 2013-08-28 22:44:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Please, teach me your ways, sir.
[ 2013-08-28 22:44:33 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | my ways of calculus?
[ 2013-08-28 22:44:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Of Basedness.
[ 2013-08-28 22:44:57 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | idk anything about that
[ 2013-08-28 22:45:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | And yet, you are so confident of yourself. Lol.
[ 2013-08-28 22:45:51 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm confident about non-based things, jalen.  big difference.
[ 2013-08-28 22:46:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | But you have more of the confidence that a person would need to even be considered Based unlike myself.
[ 2013-08-28 22:47:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | So, I will still consider you a mentor to a man such as myself.
[ 2013-08-28 22:48:08 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | thank you
[ 2013-08-28 22:48:10 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | based jalen
[ 2013-08-28 22:48:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | And yet, you call me Based. I'd cry tears of joy knowing that you believe that there is hope for me, but surely, that is an exaggeration, sir.
[ 2013-08-28 22:49:56 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | whatever you say, based jalen
[ 2013-08-28 22:50:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Maybe, one day I can believe you when I successfully court a woman for the first time.

[ 2013-08-29 04:19:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Big Sean is good.
[ 2013-08-29 04:20:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Mac Miller is also good. He's also the only white rapper to be called out (with the exception of Drake who is half).
[ 2013-08-29 04:20:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | My mom needs to listen to that verse.
[ 2013-08-29 04:20:53 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | She actually told me about the song but didn't listen to it.
[ 2013-08-29 04:21:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | She heard about the controversy behind that Kendrick was claiming he was the king of the east coast.
[ 2013-08-29 04:21:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | At first, I was worried and attributed to bravado and the start of Kendrick's demise, but I know that's not true at all.
[ 2013-08-29 04:22:05 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i pretty much only know drake and big sean i think
[ 2013-08-29 04:22:06 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-29 04:22:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Kendrick really could be the the third coming of 2Pac and Notorious BIG.
[ 2013-08-29 04:22:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | The second would be Busta Rhymes, Eminem, Nas, Jay Z, Andre 3000, and even Tech N9ne I think.
[ 2013-08-29 04:22:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Nas has a lot of respect for T9.
[ 2013-08-29 04:23:08 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | But damn, that King of Both Coasts title looks good on K.Dot.
[ 2013-08-29 04:25:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | He wants to make sure his fans don't even want to listen to him (That's not to be taken seriously. It's more of a call to competition).
[ 2013-08-29 04:25:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | The way he delivered it was insane!
[ 2013-08-29 04:26:08 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Because as far as I'm concerned, he did that for me. I don't care about either other rapper in that song, their work, or the rappers he called out.
[ 2013-08-29 04:26:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'd certainly question their content less after hearing that godlike verse.
[ 2013-08-29 04:26:54 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Fuck it! Kendrick Lamar is beyond Based God. He doesn't need something as petty as women and shit.
[ 2013-08-29 04:27:04 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | He's going to be the King of Both Motherfucking Coasts.
[ 2013-08-29 04:27:22 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-29 04:27:23 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well

[ 2013-08-29 21:18:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Do it while wearing a provocative shirt, showing how much you love black women.
[ 2013-08-29 21:19:13 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-29 21:19:35 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | josh is not racist

[ 2013-08-29 21:20:23 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | according to this white girl on facebook if i try to appreciate a culture that used to be oppressed then i'm being racist, even if i'm not being negative about it
[ 2013-08-29 21:20:32 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | XD
[ 2013-08-29 21:20:35 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol

[ 2013-08-29 21:21:14 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | while you are white
[ 2013-08-29 21:21:21 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | (but i didnt say that)
[ 2013-08-29 21:22:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Lol, I would have been like, &quot;Go on, talk, my white sista. \m/&quot;
[ 2013-08-29 21:22:17 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-29 21:22:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | And, she'd be like, &quot;This nerdy lookin'  black guy is givin' me the Devil Horns... \m/&quot;
[ 2013-08-29 21:22:49 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-29 21:22:53 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well jalen
[ 2013-08-29 21:23:05 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | they said childish gambino used to be called &quot;nerdy lookin'&quot; as well
[ 2013-08-29 21:23:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Childish Gambino is my hero.
[ 2013-08-29 21:23:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I love how he's so open about being attracted to white and asian women.
[ 2013-08-29 21:24:14 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | He even says in his songs how much he loves &quot;Beckys.&quot;
[ 2013-08-29 21:24:25 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | what are beckys
[ 2013-08-29 21:24:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | White girls.
[ 2013-08-29 21:24:36 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | oh
[ 2013-08-29 21:24:38 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-29 21:25:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Oh, yeah, black men can like their share of white women, too. Most of us just aren't that open about it.
[ 2013-08-29 21:25:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Wait, why am I saying that? I'm barely black if at all...
[ 2013-08-29 21:25:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | A lot of black men love Kim Kardashian, and she's not even all that white.
[ 2013-08-29 21:25:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That just goes to show that most of us don't care in the end.
[ 2013-08-29 21:25:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Again, this is assuming I'm black.
[ 2013-08-29 21:25:58 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | its harder to find white men that like black girls and vice versa i think
[ 2013-08-29 21:26:06 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but then again it's not that hard to find either
[ 2013-08-29 21:26:08 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-29 21:26:12 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | especially in clubs
[ 2013-08-29 21:26:23 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah, and that's because black women are the least likely of the race/sex combinations to date and marry outside their race.
[ 2013-08-29 21:26:28 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | really?
[ 2013-08-29 21:26:29 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | dammit
[ 2013-08-29 21:26:30 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-29 21:26:46 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'll try to find that article.
[ 2013-08-29 21:26:54 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'll just have to move up north where nobody cares about race

[ 2013-08-29 21:26:56 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i can see that
[ 2013-08-29 21:28:48 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_relationships">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_relationships</a>
[ 2013-08-29 21:29:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I can't find it in particular, but parts of this is a really interesting read.
[ 2013-08-29 21:29:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | For instance, there are more Afro-Chinese in the world than you might think.
[ 2013-08-29 21:29:36 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ok class is over, we'll be back in a bit
[ 2013-08-29 21:29:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Where, the mother is black, and the father is chinese.
[ 2013-08-29 21:29:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Alright.
[ 2013-08-29 21:29:59 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | also personally i dont care what race the person is, it's hard enough finding somebody that i find attractive that also finds me attractive
[ 2013-08-29 21:30:00 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-29 21:30:02 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | brb
[ 2013-08-29 21:30:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | True, and alright.
[ 2013-08-29 21:35:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | From: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_marriage">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_marriage</a> under the section &quot;United States:&quot; 
In 2008, 22% of all black male newlyweds married interracially while only 9% of black female newlyweds married outside their race, making them the least likely of any race or gender to marry outside their race and the least likely to get married at all.
[ 2013-08-29 21:36:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | And I have to agree, Josh. Part of the reason why I want to move out further west or north is the South's heritage in that regard.
[ 2013-08-29 21:37:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I love this region. Getting over high school and even college immaturity, I'll come to miss the food and the hospitality.
[ 2013-08-29 21:37:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | But one thing's for certain: I love White women so much that I don't feel the difference in skin color at all.
[ 2013-08-29 21:38:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm African American, yes. I won't deny this, but I don't feel &quot;Black&quot; or &quot;urban.&quot; A lot of African Americans have a problem with those terms like I do.
[ 2013-08-29 21:39:04 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Regardless, I am as attracted to white females as if I never was &quot;Black&quot; or &quot;urban&quot; to begin with.
[ 2013-08-29 21:40:14 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I feel as white, as *American* as anyone else, without worrying about the ethnic adjective in the front that classifies me.
[ 2013-08-29 22:47:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Your White Girl Lover is back.
[ 2013-08-29 22:48:02 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | what
[ 2013-08-29 22:49:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | If I was perfect, I would have the charisma to take all your beautiful white girls away from you.
[ 2013-08-29 22:49:23 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That's what I'm saying.
[ 2013-08-29 22:49:58 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | if my white girl left me, she isn't worth it.
[ 2013-08-29 22:50:21 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Lol.
[ 2013-08-29 22:50:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Someone who truly cares about you won't, JT.
[ 2013-08-29 22:50:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Don't worry about it.
[ 2013-08-29 22:51:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | We have plenty of decades to enjoy life according to statistics and the current life span of Americans.
[ 2013-08-29 22:51:53 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | fuck statistics
[ 2013-08-29 22:52:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Lol, JT is like, &quot;Fuck that. I'm going to live to 200.&quot;
[ 2013-08-29 22:54:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Alas, I am not Based by any means.
[ 2013-08-29 22:55:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I just want one.
[ 2013-08-29 22:55:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | *The* one. <ss type="smile">:)</ss>
[ 2013-08-29 22:55:32 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | jalen if you get married
[ 2013-08-29 22:55:42 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | do you want your wife to die first or you?
[ 2013-08-29 22:55:54 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | im going to die at the same time as my wife
[ 2013-08-29 22:56:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'd be devestated either way, man.
[ 2013-08-29 22:56:16 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Seriously, that's something I don't even want to analyze yet.
[ 2013-08-29 22:56:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | If a woman - I don't care what race she is - showed me love and wanted to be with me for the rest of our lives, that very thought would devestate me.
[ 2013-08-29 23:00:14 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Althought, as a somewhat related side note, I am a jerk, JT.
[ 2013-08-29 23:00:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I, unfortunately, still have quite high physical standards.
[ 2013-08-29 23:00:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Not 10s, but 7s and 8s.
[ 2013-08-29 23:00:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | A 7 would be perfect for me in my opinion, but still, what about 1 through 6?
[ 2013-08-29 23:01:04 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it's k jalen
[ 2013-08-29 23:01:04 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That might be too high.
[ 2013-08-29 23:01:08 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | last year i gave lydia a 10
[ 2013-08-29 23:01:13 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and every other girl 5's
[ 2013-08-29 23:02:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Well, surely, I'd consider her to be a 10 overall because, hopefully, everything else about her would be 8 or higher (For whatever reason, we humans like to say, &quot;Oh, he or shie is a 10,&quot; even though no one is that perfect). XD
[ 2013-08-29 23:03:45 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well jalen
[ 2013-08-29 23:03:49 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm more of a jerk than you
[ 2013-08-29 23:03:57 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | since i gave a bunch of girls 5s
[ 2013-08-29 23:04:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Lol.
[ 2013-08-29 23:04:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Regardless, my point is that I'm no different those a lot of straight men.
[ 2013-08-29 23:04:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'd rather take the body over the personality.
[ 2013-08-29 23:05:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'd sacrifice a few points of the latter for the former.
[ 2013-08-29 23:05:10 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's a terrible vice of mine.
[ 2013-08-29 23:06:50 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it's k jalen
[ 2013-08-29 23:07:09 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | humans naturally look at physical features first
[ 2013-08-29 23:07:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | We shouldn't. If only our bodies would just be quiet for more than a few minutes.
[ 2013-08-29 23:08:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | But I see a sorosititute, and I'm like, &quot;You so aren't beneath me. Not even close to the basket.&quot;
[ 2013-08-29 23:08:42 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | jalen that is bad
[ 2013-08-29 23:08:46 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | XD
[ 2013-08-29 23:08:46 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | looking down on people
[ 2013-08-29 23:08:56 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | No, I said &quot;aren't.&quot;
[ 2013-08-29 23:09:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Read carefully.
[ 2013-08-29 23:09:06 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | jalen that is bad
[ 2013-08-29 23:09:12 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | looking up at people
[ 2013-08-29 23:09:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | What I mean is that I would be willing to partake in casual, safe sex with sorority girls if they asked me to.
[ 2013-08-29 23:09:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That's a troubling vice.
[ 2013-08-29 23:09:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | This is why feminists hate us straight men. XD
[ 2013-08-29 23:09:49 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well that would be fine since it is straight sex
[ 2013-08-29 23:09:58 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and i'm sure some females would enjoy sex too
[ 2013-08-29 23:10:32 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Hmm... I wonder if we should strive for this before we graduate...
[ 2013-08-29 23:10:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I would not deny it.
[ 2013-08-29 23:10:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | The d3mons would be too powerful that one night...
[ 2013-08-29 23:10:53 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | as long i don't get a child
[ 2013-08-29 23:10:59 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm ok with it
[ 2013-08-29 23:11:08 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i also have to trust the female too
[ 2013-08-29 23:11:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yes, I will make sure the protection does not have any holes in it...
[ 2013-08-29 23:11:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Tyler said that in order for me to prove that I'm not Based, and this is the ironic kicker, I have to have a one night stand.
[ 2013-08-29 23:11:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | XDDD
[ 2013-08-29 23:11:55 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | jalen
[ 2013-08-29 23:11:58 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | just don't get aids
[ 2013-08-29 23:12:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm all up for safe sex, but if there is no protection, I absolutely refuse.
[ 2013-08-29 23:12:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I don't care if people think that condoms are for pussies.
[ 2013-08-29 23:13:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'd respond, &quot;I am what I (want to) eat.&quot;
[ 2013-08-29 23:17:10 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | idk if we are both tested and she is on birth control then it might be fine
[ 2013-08-29 23:17:21 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Exactly.
[ 2013-08-29 23:18:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | The two people who have to trust each other to be completely monogamous. That's all, but for a *one night stand,* cough, Tyler said that, cough, USE PROTECTION.
[ 2013-08-29 23:23:21 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | too much risks
[ 2013-08-29 23:23:22 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | don't do it
[ 2013-08-29 23:24:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm not sure just yet. I don't believe I'll be tempted this year, but it's going to arrive before college ends for me.
[ 2013-08-29 23:24:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Protection, protection, protection.
[ 2013-08-29 23:24:36 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | no jalen
[ 2013-08-29 23:24:54 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | one night stands is not worth it
[ 2013-08-29 23:26:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'd agree with that. I just hope my girlfriend enjoys sexual pleasure, otherwise I would die.
[ 2013-08-29 23:28:04 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so jalen
[ 2013-08-29 23:28:10 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | have you been talking to anyone?
[ 2013-08-29 23:29:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Nah. Although, I feel that could change this year.
[ 2013-08-29 23:29:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's something I want to experience before I graduate, but I'm in no rush.
[ 2013-08-29 23:29:46 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Understandably, I don't have that much time, so I'll give it another round.
[ 2013-08-29 23:30:10 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | at least start talking to girls.
[ 2013-08-29 23:30:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's more difficult to do than say.
[ 2013-08-29 23:30:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | XD
[ 2013-08-29 23:30:45 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it's k jalen
[ 2013-08-29 23:30:46 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i got you

[ 2013-08-29 23:31:59 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | or next week
[ 2013-08-29 23:32:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Hunting? This reminds of &quot;Hunterish&quot; by Tech N9ne featuring Irv Da Phenom and Krizz Kaliko.
[ 2013-08-29 23:34:47 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | o_O
[ 2013-08-29 23:35:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Lol, Josh. Sorry that you've been subjected to my thoughts. Forgive me.
[ 2013-08-29 23:36:26 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | too bad josh can't join us
[ 2013-08-29 23:37:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Doesn't he already have ladies already?
[ 2013-08-29 23:37:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | He's many steps ahead of us.
[ 2013-08-29 23:37:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I salute you, sir.
[ 2013-08-29 23:37:44 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | doesn't mean he can't get more
[ 2013-08-29 23:38:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | True.

[ 2013-08-29 23:41:13 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I want to do something like that for my wife. Should she want to have my child.
[ 2013-08-29 23:41:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Hey, man, if my pregnant wife wants ice cream, I'd try to give her as much as she'd like.
[ 2013-08-29 23:41:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | We never have to think about carrying a child.
[ 2013-08-29 23:41:44 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | jt you don't get to decide what your wife eats when she's pregnant
[ 2013-08-29 23:41:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | So fucking true.
[ 2013-08-29 23:41:55 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Tell this man.
[ 2013-08-29 23:42:02 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | she decides what she eats and it's usually something fucked up that she doesn't usually eat
[ 2013-08-29 23:42:12 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | cuz pregnancy does weird shit to u
[ 2013-08-29 23:42:14 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | no no no

[ 2013-08-29 23:42:21 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | we have to think about the child here
[ 2013-08-29 23:42:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's not going to hurt the child, darn you.
[ 2013-08-29 23:42:33 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | can't have it get addicted to ice cream
[ 2013-08-29 23:42:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | The doctor is going to tell her what she can and cannot eat.
[ 2013-08-29 23:42:46 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | people have been giving birth for a long long time jt and they eat what they feel like when they're going to do it

[ 2013-08-31 18:58:51 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | that is why that happened
[ 2013-08-31 18:59:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Did he delete you from his contact as well?
[ 2013-08-31 18:59:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I'm not sure if Tyler knows yet, but he will soon enough.
[ 2013-08-31 18:59:55 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I can't believe JT was following Lydia yesterday...
[ 2013-08-31 18:59:55 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | No I still have him
[ 2013-08-31 19:00:08 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | So, he's only deleted Josh and myself so far.
[ 2013-08-31 19:00:16 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | That means he has a vendetta against the two of us.
[ 2013-08-31 19:00:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I don't understand why me.
[ 2013-08-31 19:00:53 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Josh knew that Emily was coming yesterday, and he told JT that he was going to see her and Lydia at Lydia's apartment.
[ 2013-08-31 19:01:13 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | It's definitely out of spite, and JT is definitely in the wrong, but I can see why he'd delete Josh.
[ 2013-08-31 19:01:39 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Something tells me he did the same to Tyler because if he didn't, Tyler is going to chew him out.
[ 2013-08-31 19:02:01 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | So did Josh tell you yesterday?
[ 2013-08-31 19:02:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | No, I just found out when I got online just over an hour ago.
[ 2013-08-31 19:02:56 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | All I know is that JT said he was going to the movies.
[ 2013-08-31 19:03:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | In the group chat, he left at 1:25 PM, which I just saw.
[ 2013-08-31 19:03:54 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Skype must have been slow to update because I would have saw it, so he's definitely mad.
[ 2013-08-31 19:04:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | He's going to get no love from me because he deserves to get what's coming to him by Tyler and the rest of us.<e_m ts="1377975859" a="jalen.benjamin" t="61"/>

[ 2013-08-31 19:04:49 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | and made her uncomfortable somehow
[ 2013-08-31 19:05:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | besides last time i talked to him he was upset
[2:06:55 PM] Jalen Benjamin: Why is that?
[2:07:00 PM] Joshua Breece: he knows lydia is at our apartment building
[2:07:04 PM] Joshua Breece: in building f
[2:07:08 PM] Jalen Benjamin: Oh no...
[2:07:10 PM] Joshua Breece: according to lydia when he saw them he was like
[2:07:14 PM] Joshua Breece: poking his head around the corner
[2:07:19 PM] Jalen Benjamin: Shit...
[2:07:20 PM] Joshua Breece: watching them walk to their apartment
[2:07:21 PM] Joshua Breece: like

[ 2013-08-31 19:06:09 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | wtf
[ 2013-08-31 19:06:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | This happened after 8, the last time JT talked to me on the main chat.
[ 2013-08-31 19:07:08 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | It could have happened beforehand as well, and Lydia could have later told him to back off after the last time we spoke.
[ 2013-08-31 19:07:23 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I even saw Lydia yesterday, too.
[ 2013-08-31 19:07:55 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | If it had happened before then (about 1:00), she would have stopped me and told me about it.
[ 2013-08-31 19:08:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | This is bad. I feel a restraining order coming at this rate.
[ 2013-08-31 19:10:13 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | And I thought that part was over
[ 2013-08-31 19:10:22 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | in his life
[ 2013-08-31 19:12:17 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | aw crap
[ 2013-08-31 19:12:34 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | and he left the chat. This is a dire situation, no doubt about it.
[ 2013-08-31 19:12:38 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Why didn't he delete me?
[ 2013-08-31 19:13:32 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | He probably thinks you'd be the only person who wouldn't get upset with him over this, but understand this from me, Edward, you need to be.
[ 2013-08-31 19:14:08 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | If he contacts you or you see him online hiding away from us, he needs to know that Lydia is becoming slowly more terrified of him.
[ 2013-08-31 19:14:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | We're not accepting that.
[ 2013-08-31 19:14:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | None of us.
[ 2013-08-31 19:18:44 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I understand.
[ 2013-08-31 19:18:51 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | According to Skype,
[ 2013-08-31 19:18:58 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | he is actually online right now
[ 2013-08-31 19:20:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Tell him that we all know (I just told Tyler), and Lydia is not happy about it.
[ 2013-08-31 19:20:42 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Oh no. Tyler knows now?
[ 2013-08-31 19:20:48 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | All hell is going to break loose.
[ 2013-08-31 19:20:58 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | He is the one most sensitive about that situation
[ 2013-08-31 19:23:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | He worries about her the most. He has to know.
[ 2013-08-31 19:26:12 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | So... what is he saying?
[ 2013-08-31 19:27:10 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I'm still giving him the details. I think he's texting Lydia right now.
[ 2013-08-31 19:27:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I don't meant to be overdramatic about it, but I wish JT would learn his lesson.
[ 2013-08-31 19:29:10 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Yeah. I thought he really was over it by now
[ 2013-08-31 19:30:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Nah, I knew. He made references to her in the main chat in the past week.
[ 2013-08-31 19:31:49 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Oh yeah there is that
[ 2013-08-31 19:32:15 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | But it looks like he didn't listen to you guys last time
[ 2013-08-31 19:32:20 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | if he is still continuing this
[ 2013-08-31 19:34:39 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | If he is still continuing this, then Lydia will have to do something.
[ 2013-08-31 19:35:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | If she wants to, she can get a restraining order. I'm sure she'd have our approval.
[ 2013-08-31 19:35:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | It might be up to her to talk with him one on one, and tell him what's best for her.
[ 2013-08-31 19:37:41 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | A restraining order would be  the worst case scenario
[ 2013-08-31 19:38:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | It's been going on for over a year now. What else can we do?
[ 2013-08-31 19:41:44 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | True.
[ 2013-08-31 19:41:58 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Will that go on his record?
[ 2013-08-31 19:42:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I didn't consider this. It actually might.
[ 2013-08-31 19:43:35 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Not good for employmen
[ 2013-08-31 19:48:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I told Josh that, and he added that she's fine about it now because she's more worried about other stuff.
[ 2013-08-31 19:48:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | JT's just being a coward right now.
[ 2013-08-31 19:55:20 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I just hope I never act this way around a woman for that long.
[ 2013-08-31 19:56:32 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | If you don't want to be in any sort of romantic/physical relationship, I'll be sure to respect that as soon as possible. Hopefully, from the first second.
[ 2013-08-31 19:57:29 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Lol... Actually, wouldn't it be something we should try at least once?
[ 2013-08-31 19:57:47 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | a romantic relationship, sure we give it alot of shit
[ 2013-08-31 19:57:57 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | but, have we actually fully gave it a chance?
[ 2013-08-31 19:58:04 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I know I never have.

[ 2013-08-31 22:32:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah, and he removed Josh and me from his contacts.
[ 2013-08-31 22:32:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | He didn't do so for Edward.
[ 2013-08-31 22:33:11 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that's interesting.  i wonder for how long.
[ 2013-08-31 22:33:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Did he do that to you?
[ 2013-08-31 22:34:11 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah.
[ 2013-08-31 22:34:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | He did it because he knows what we would say.
[ 2013-08-31 22:36:29 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | was he intentionally stalking her?
[ 2013-08-31 22:37:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm not sure about that.
[ 2013-08-31 22:37:14 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | maybe josh will find out.  i want to know.
[ 2013-08-31 22:37:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Have you spoken to her?
[ 2013-08-31 22:38:09 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah.  she said that i shouldn't worry about it.

[ 2013-08-31 22:38:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Man! She has a lot of patience.
[ 2013-08-31 22:43:49 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah.  i just hope for jt's sake that he wasn't doing it inentionally
[ 2013-08-31 22:44:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I don't think I even have to ask what you'd do if it was.
[ 2013-08-31 22:45:23 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yepp.
[ 2013-08-31 22:50:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I hope so, but, Tyler, if it just happened to be a coincidence, JT would not have removed us from Skype.
[ 2013-08-31 22:50:46 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah.  that's why i'm wondering if i can get a ride to usc right now.  i'm thinking it over.
[ 2013-08-31 22:51:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | He might have been motivated by jealousy as well. Let me copy-paste part of my conversation with Josh here.
[ 2013-08-31 22:51:34 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | all righty
[ 2013-08-31 22:52:20 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | [2:07:57 PM] Joshua Breece: probably
[2:08:02 PM] Joshua Breece: he also knows that i went to hang out with her too
[2:08:09 PM] Joshua Breece: like yesterday
[2:08:10 PM] Jalen Benjamin: Oh...
[2:08:16 PM] Joshua Breece: i told him i was going to see emily cuz she was here
[2:08:18 PM] Joshua Breece: and he asked where
[2:08:23 PM] Joshua Breece: and i was like in lydias apartment
[2:08:26 PM] Joshua Breece: cuz i knew he already knew
[ 2013-08-31 22:52:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | So, there's a strong possibility it was intentional.
[ 2013-08-31 22:53:34 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah.  hmm.
[ 2013-08-31 23:12:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Hey, Josh.

[ 2013-08-31 23:23:14 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Who knows? Some of the students might enjoy it.
[ 2013-08-31 23:23:34 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | no one enjoys it jalen
[ 2013-08-31 23:23:35 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | no one
[ 2013-08-31 23:24:23 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | But, what about the women that already use such a tool? If this is truly literall,-...
[ 2013-08-31 23:26:05 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well, it's like the size of clemson university

[ 2013-08-31 23:26:55 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's too big, ka?
[ 2013-08-31 23:27:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It really is not about the size as everyone says, eh?
[ 2013-08-31 23:27:14 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ka is one of the sorrities here
[ 2013-08-31 23:27:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Nani!?
[ 2013-08-31 23:27:29 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well, not really.  it's kappa delta
[ 2013-08-31 23:27:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | XD
[ 2013-08-31 23:27:37 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but delta looks like an A
[ 2013-08-31 23:30:10 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | They've invited you to a party? :OO
[ 2013-08-31 23:30:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Ahhhhhhhhhh

[ 2013-08-31 23:30:28 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i didn't say that . . .
[ 2013-08-31 23:30:46 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Ah, I thought you were implying something here. <ss type="wink">;)</ss>
[ 2013-08-31 23:31:38 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | oh, lol no.
[ 2013-08-31 23:32:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Shimata! Then those people should fear your charisma and might!
[ 2013-08-31 23:32:37 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | O.O
[ 2013-08-31 23:41:08 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Oh, Tyler, we can talk about this later when you aren't busy, but counselor believes that my values of self-esteem are lacking.
[ 2013-08-31 23:41:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | This could mean my self-esteem gets substantially better once I realize what those are.
[ 2013-08-31 23:42:55 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | you don't know what your values are?
[ 2013-08-31 23:43:23 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I have a few, but I should have more than what I listed at our appointment yesterday.
[ 2013-08-31 23:45:27 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i value VICTORY
[ 2013-08-31 23:45:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Lol. I value relationships too much it seems.
[ 2013-08-31 23:46:04 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | then why do you lose so often, josh?
[ 2013-08-31 23:46:24 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well tyler
[ 2013-08-31 23:46:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Friendships is what I mean by relationships.
[ 2013-08-31 23:46:41 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | whether or not i value it does not determine whether i am successful in life
[ 2013-08-31 23:46:47 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so you suck?

[ 2013-08-31 23:49:03 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'd love to watch
[ 2013-08-31 23:49:03 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | dang it supper time
[ 2013-08-31 23:49:03 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but
[ 2013-08-31 23:49:03 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-08-31 23:49:09 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | be back in a bit
[ 2013-08-31 23:49:11 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm in the middle of catching up on work
[ 2013-08-31 23:49:13 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | =o
[ 2013-09-01 00:25:46 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | omg
[ 2013-09-01 00:25:47 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | tsm so good
[ 2013-09-01 00:56:31 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i love calculus . . .
[ 2013-09-01 01:01:25 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | me too
[ 2013-09-01 01:03:45 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i want it to die, josh
[ 2013-09-01 01:03:46 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | all of it
[ 2013-09-01 01:07:21 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-09-01 01:07:28 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but it's just vector right!
[ 2013-09-01 01:07:59 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | O.O
[ 2013-09-01 01:08:27 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so i'm supposed to find the volume of this parallelpiped with the vectors a, b, and c
[ 2013-09-01 01:08:32 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and i know what you're thinking
[ 2013-09-01 01:08:33 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | easy, right?
[ 2013-09-01 01:08:35 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-09-01 01:08:52 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well idk which vector goes to which side of the parallelpiped
[ 2013-09-01 01:08:59 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so what do?
[ 2013-09-01 01:10:45 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah Tyler. My cal hw is pretty annoying too
[ 2013-09-01 01:10:46 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i guess i could just cross product them
[ 2013-09-01 01:10:50 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | oh, hi edward
[ 2013-09-01 01:10:55 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | always cross product
[ 2013-09-01 01:10:59 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and then use that to see which one has the 90 degree angle
[ 2013-09-01 01:11:06 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | then i would know which ones go where
[ 2013-09-01 01:11:36 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That makes sense.
[ 2013-09-01 01:11:40 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | then i could just do V=Ah=|b x c|*|a|cos(theta)
[ 2013-09-01 01:12:24 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Looks about right. I can visualize that
[ 2013-09-01 01:12:32 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | aka |a~(bxc)|
[ 2013-09-01 01:12:37 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i wish we had the use of dots on our keyboards
[ 2013-09-01 01:15:49 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Tyler did you take differential equations yet?
[ 2013-09-01 01:16:24 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | not yet
[ 2013-09-01 01:16:26 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | If you thought Calculus made you hate life
[ 2013-09-01 01:16:28 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that's next semester
[ 2013-09-01 01:16:30 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | omg
[ 2013-09-01 01:16:50 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | diff eq is a huge pain in the ass.
[ 2013-09-01 01:17:05 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah, i heard.
[ 2013-09-01 01:17:07 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ugh

[ 2013-09-01 01:17:14 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Like... It made me hate life at G school
[ 2013-09-01 01:17:25 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It made everybody hate life
[ 2013-09-01 01:18:23 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | hmm.  sounds like my kind of class.  is lotion allowed?
[ 2013-09-01 01:18:46 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | of course
[ 2013-09-01 01:18:54 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well that makes it easier
[ 2013-09-01 01:19:02 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm going to have to take it next semester as well
[ 2013-09-01 01:19:13 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | probably along with discrete
[ 2013-09-01 01:19:32 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ahh.  so did you buy your lotion yet?
[ 2013-09-01 01:19:40 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | or are you just going to let them go dry?
[ 2013-09-01 01:19:48 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | not enough lotion
[ 2013-09-01 01:19:51 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | never enough lotion
[ 2013-09-01 01:19:53 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol

[ 2013-09-01 01:20:49 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Lol.. I feel your pain Tyler. We will go through this together
[ 2013-09-01 01:21:13 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | mmm.  sounds like fun.  a three-some.  and only one of them is conscenting.
[ 2013-09-01 01:22:05 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Welcome to college guyths
[ 2013-09-01 01:22:16 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | makes me cry
[ 2013-09-01 01:22:52 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and bleed
[ 2013-09-01 01:23:49 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | How many more math classes do you have to take?
[ 2013-09-01 01:24:08 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | depends on what you count as math
[ 2013-09-01 01:24:17 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | officially, it's diff eq and statistics
[ 2013-09-01 01:24:32 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but i like to think that statics is a math class, too
[ 2013-09-01 01:25:17 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ahh Statics and dynamics?
[ 2013-09-01 01:25:26 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | nah, just statics
[ 2013-09-01 01:25:35 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well.. it is physics
[ 2013-09-01 01:25:42 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but statics and dynamics . . .
[ 2013-09-01 01:25:44 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that course
[ 2013-09-01 01:25:43 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | is

[ 2013-09-01 01:27:29 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | awesome
[ 2013-09-01 01:27:41 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It makes me sad
[ 2013-09-01 01:28:41 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i hope they didn't advertise small classes
[ 2013-09-01 01:30:28 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Lol not for comp sci.
[ 2013-09-01 01:30:46 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-09-01 03:12:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I have returned.
[ 2013-09-01 03:12:23 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Edwared, I don't understand how anyone is suppose to learn in a class that grand.

[ 2013-09-01 03:30:31 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i believe he was exaggerating to me on the text message but better safe than sorry i suppose
[ 2013-09-01 03:30:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Okay. It'll be up to you mostly, though.
[ 2013-09-01 03:31:02 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i can try to facebook message him i guess but

[ 2013-09-01 04:16:06 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | after i got on
[ 2013-09-01 04:16:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That's interesting.
[ 2013-09-01 04:17:15 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ugh.  oh well.  i'll just talk to him another time.

[ 2013-09-01 04:17:39 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah. He's at his house.
[ 2013-09-01 04:17:51 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that really sucks, then
[ 2013-09-01 04:17:58 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that means jt is all alone
[ 2013-09-01 04:18:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | He mentioned that.
[ 2013-09-01 04:18:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | There's not much even I can do.
[ 2013-09-01 04:18:59 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah.  i just don't want anyone to do anything stupid.
[ 2013-09-01 04:19:07 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but with my track record of things going my way
[ 2013-09-01 04:19:12 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | . . .
[ 2013-09-01 04:19:20 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well he was up an hour ago according to fb
[ 2013-09-01 04:19:21 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so that's something
[ 2013-09-01 04:19:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I feel like if JT wants help, then he'll contact us.
[ 2013-09-01 04:20:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | To delete us from his Skype contacts is suspicious in that it gives the impression that he knows he's in the wrong.
[ 2013-09-01 04:20:30 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | or he doesn't want to be talked to
[ 2013-09-01 04:20:45 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | secluding yourself from others is a common sign of depression
[ 2013-09-01 04:20:56 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | or that you're about to do something stupid
[ 2013-09-01 04:21:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I can't do anything about it.
[ 2013-09-01 04:21:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's a 30 to 40 minute walk to Riverside, and I don't know exactly where he or Lydia lives.
[ 2013-09-01 04:22:39 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah, i know.  you can do about as much as i can at this point.
[ 2013-09-01 04:22:48 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | this is why i don't like you people being so far away
[ 2013-09-01 04:23:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Definitely. I'm glad Edward has a much better head on his shoulders than JT does.
[ 2013-09-01 04:24:04 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | He's going to need it being three time zones away.
[ 2013-09-01 04:24:16 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah that's true
[ 2013-09-01 04:25:32 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | What are we going to do after college? In no more than five years, I don't expect to be in this state.
[ 2013-09-01 04:25:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | If JT has a problem like this again, then I definitely won't be able to do anything about it.
[ 2013-09-01 04:26:05 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | if he doesn't stop the problem now, i don't know what i'm going to do.
[ 2013-09-01 04:26:18 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | he needs to stop being such a whiny . . .
[ 2013-09-01 04:26:21 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | nevermind
[ 2013-09-01 04:26:24 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i've already had this rant
[ 2013-09-01 04:26:26 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | no need for it again
[ 2013-09-01 04:27:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah. He's got to work at this himself.
[ 2013-09-01 04:27:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Even if we all stay in South Carolina, I still can't do anything.
[ 2013-09-01 04:27:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's time for him to prove his worth.
[ 2013-09-01 04:28:55 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I mean, I consider this so trivial. I care, and then I think, &quot;Come on. You're one of 7+ billion people. Billions of people wish they could be you right now. Get over it.&quot;
[ 2013-09-01 04:29:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I can't have much sympathy with how long this has been going on and realizing that his problems are so trivial when thought in a global perspective.
[ 2013-09-01 04:30:25 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | his problems are trivial in the local perspective.  he . . . ugh.  idc anymore.
[ 2013-09-01 04:31:10 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | just heard a gunshot
[ 2013-09-01 04:31:12 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | O.O
[ 2013-09-01 04:32:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Be safe, man.
[ 2013-09-01 04:32:33 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | we just had a clemson/georgia game
[ 2013-09-01 04:32:40 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | idk if that has anything to do with it
[ 2013-09-01 04:33:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Oh wow. I know there was a lot of bad blood out there tonight.
[ 2013-09-01 04:33:20 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | The USC/Georgia game is going to be even worse.
[ 2013-09-01 04:33:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | We embarrassed Georgia last year, and next week, we go to their stadium.
[ 2013-09-01 04:33:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | USC's team is going to get harrassed.
[ 2013-09-01 04:34:13 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah.  hmm.  maybe it's really loud fire works.  there went another.
[ 2013-09-01 04:34:40 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i hear sirens . . .
[ 2013-09-01 04:34:47 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | crap
[ 2013-09-01 04:35:21 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It must have just ended.
[ 2013-09-01 04:35:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Oh, yeah, you said that.
[ 2013-09-01 04:35:39 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | The students are going crazy.
[ 2013-09-01 04:36:40 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah, i don't like that
[ 2013-09-01 04:36:44 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | there are a lot of people here
[ 2013-09-01 04:36:46 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | a lot of kids
[ 2013-09-01 04:38:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | As long as they don't bang on your door all night, it should be okay. Lol.
[ 2013-09-01 04:38:25 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well if that was gunfire . . .
[ 2013-09-01 04:38:28 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | idk
[ 2013-09-01 04:38:37 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i just hope whoever did it missed.
[ 2013-09-01 04:40:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Clemson is going to be on lockdown if that's actual gunfire. I hope that's not the case.
[ 2013-09-01 04:40:55 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | me too
[ 2013-09-01 04:41:06 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | more sirens
[ 2013-09-01 04:43:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | So, Tyler, what have you been doing for fun?
[ 2013-09-01 04:44:17 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | hmm
[ 2013-09-01 04:44:27 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | not a whole lot
[ 2013-09-01 04:44:37 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | just hanging out, i guess
[ 2013-09-01 04:45:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That puts you in a better position than me already.
[ 2013-09-01 04:45:13 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I've only hung out with Calvin in the past three days.
[ 2013-09-01 04:45:21 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ahh
[ 2013-09-01 04:45:43 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah, my number of friends isn't incredibly large either.
[ 2013-09-01 04:46:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's about the quality more so than the quantity. My counselor is helping me understand this.
[ 2013-09-01 04:46:29 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i've always said that
[ 2013-09-01 04:46:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Anyway, Calvin is going to set me up on date later today.
[ 2013-09-01 04:46:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | He will forget.
[ 2013-09-01 04:46:56 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol

[ 2013-09-02 03:15:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I need to listen to more Mudvayne. I used to listen to a few of their songs a lot back in 9th and 10th grade.

[ 2013-09-02 04:15:48 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Nothing much. I just finished brushing and flossing. My apologies.
[ 2013-09-02 04:16:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I can't seem to muster the energy to play Skyrim.
[ 2013-09-02 04:16:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | How about you?

[ 2013-09-02 04:18:48 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol

[ 2013-09-02 04:19:56 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Okay.
[ 2013-09-02 04:20:50 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | man i dont even have a main anymore in league
[ 2013-09-02 04:20:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | At this point, I'm going to attempt to complete Borderlands 2 on my own.
[ 2013-09-02 04:20:56 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | like i thought i was a solo mid main
[ 2013-09-02 04:21:04 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but now i play everything and i mix it up
[ 2013-09-02 04:21:08 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and people be like

[ 2013-09-02 04:21:36 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-09-02 04:21:48 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | is it harder on solo jalen
[ 2013-09-02 04:22:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It is, but with Edward so far away, and JT acting so peculiar, I decided it might be time for me to go solo.
[ 2013-09-02 04:22:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's like when we played Magicka together.
[ 2013-09-02 04:23:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That was difficult with the four of us.
[ 2013-09-02 04:23:20 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | The difficulty does not go down with any less people.
[ 2013-09-02 04:23:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Borderlands 2 is sort of like that.
[ 2013-09-02 04:23:53 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | The enemies are not as hard, and they don't have as much health, but I can't notice it playing by myself because of how many there are.
[ 2013-09-02 04:39:51 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I haven't listened to much mudvayne
[ 2013-09-02 04:40:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | They're compared to Sevendust a lot.
[ 2013-09-02 04:40:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Usually, they are the number one recommendation in related artist lists.
[ 2013-09-02 04:40:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | They're definitely in the top ten almost all the time.
[ 2013-09-02 04:43:19 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | So what did you do today?
[ 2013-09-02 04:44:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Move my desks around and do the little written homework that I had.
[ 2013-09-02 04:44:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I listened to Avenged Sevenfold's new album and came away impressed by the guitar work but not the lyrics necessarily.
[ 2013-09-02 04:45:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I have to give it another listen.
[ 2013-09-02 04:47:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | How about you?

[ 2013-09-02 05:06:43 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Lol yeah
[ 2013-09-02 05:06:55 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | so chat was surprisingly dead today
[ 2013-09-02 05:08:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Yeah, that's what happens when JT isn't here.
[ 2013-09-02 05:08:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Not to mention, I didn't get on until about 7:30.
[ 2013-09-02 05:12:37 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Wow
[ 2013-09-02 05:12:44 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | nothing today huh
[ 2013-09-02 05:13:55 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Not really. Things will change with a matter of time, though, even if it takes years.
[ 2013-09-02 05:14:41 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I dont know if it will take that long
[ 2013-09-02 05:15:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | It will take three years I think. By then, I'll be out of here.
[ 2013-09-02 05:19:18 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | three years for this to end?
[ 2013-09-02 05:19:19 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | damn
[ 2013-09-02 05:19:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | It's just not that different from Governor's School.
[ 2013-09-02 05:23:30 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Ahh i see

[ 2013-09-02 05:24:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | It's just boring is all.
[ 2013-09-02 05:24:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I'd love a new venue in another part of the country.

[ 2013-09-02 05:26:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | Cool. I'm not sure how we would do that, however. I'd need some money, and I'd have to go at the proper time.
[ 2013-09-02 05:26:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I just feel like UNC would be able to provide me with much more than I have now.
[ 2013-09-02 05:26:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | I flipping <3 Stephy, Rebecca | I should have gone to NC State at least I suppose.

[ 2013-09-06 00:21:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It is mostly because your hallmates are off campus extensively for the first time, and they party as a result?

[ 2013-09-06 00:23:04 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | What are flats exactly?
[ 2013-09-06 00:23:21 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I suppose what you're saying is you don't even have to see that much to begin with.
[ 2013-09-06 00:24:30 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it's like another word for an apartment or something
[ 2013-09-06 00:24:41 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and yeah i never have to see them that much
[ 2013-09-06 00:25:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Nice. I'm looking forward to an apartment on the horseshoe next year (unless I do study abroad).

[ 2013-09-06 00:31:00 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | you couldn't help?
[ 2013-09-06 00:31:10 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i might be able to

[ 2013-09-06 00:31:27 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Find an equation of the plane.
The plane through the point 
(9, −3, −8)
 and parallel to the plane 9x − y − z = 7
[ 2013-09-06 00:31:49 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i know how to do it if the 9x-y-z=7 was perpendicular
[ 2013-09-06 00:31:59 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but idk how to get the normal vector from a parallel plane
[ 2013-09-06 00:32:50 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah idk either
[ 2013-09-06 00:33:24 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | there's probably some kind of theorem or formula to find it but idk what it is
[ 2013-09-06 00:33:48 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah. i'm thinking maybe do something with a cross product, but i'm not sure what exactly.
[ 2013-09-06 00:34:30 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well
[ 2013-09-06 00:35:25 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | if it helps at all

[ 2013-09-06 00:36:53 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol.  wait, can you find another line on that plane?
[ 2013-09-06 00:37:05 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | like, not &lt;9,-1,-1&gt;
[ 2013-09-06 00:37:08 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but another one?
[ 2013-09-06 00:38:51 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ok so wait
[ 2013-09-06 00:39:00 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | what if i said there was some point x,y,z
[ 2013-09-06 00:39:27 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and then subtracted the (9,-3,8) from (x,y,z) to give me a vector
[ 2013-09-06 00:39:42 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and then what if i took the dot product of that and the other vector already given
[ 2013-09-06 00:39:48 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and set that equal to 0?
[ 2013-09-06 00:40:51 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | fuck idk

[ 2013-09-09 03:08:24 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and they said there was nothing that could be done to fix it
[ 2013-09-09 03:08:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Darn it. I've never heard of that ISP either.

[ 2013-09-10 03:48:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Never mind the fact that she is lying and using her sex appeal-...
[ 2013-09-10 03:48:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | She's scammed people out of their money and possessions.
[ 2013-09-10 03:48:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | (See her mail time videos as an example)
[ 2013-09-10 03:49:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | That's what I'm disgused by.
[ 2013-09-10 03:49:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I don't even care if her gameplays are fake.
[ 2013-09-10 03:49:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I've suspected this for over a month now.
[ 2013-09-10 03:49:29 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | how did she scam them?
[ 2013-09-10 03:50:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | They give her so much stuff.
[ 2013-09-10 03:50:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | She has so many XBox controllers and the like.
[ 2013-09-10 03:51:55 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I unsubscribed from her earlier.
[ 2013-09-10 03:52:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I couldn't call myself a real gamer if I did what she did and allowed people to give me gifts such as customized controllers and headsets.
[ 2013-09-10 03:53:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | It's still speculation, of course, but Raya won't even address it.
[ 2013-09-10 03:53:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | She's blocking even the people that ask her to do a 1v1 vs SSSniperWolf.
[ 2013-09-10 03:53:54 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | How disrespectful.
[ 2013-09-10 03:54:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I won't support someone who does that.
[ 2013-09-10 03:54:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | By the way, I saw her subscription count drop earlier.
[ 2013-09-10 03:55:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | This is becoming one of the biggest video gaming channel scams in YouTube's history.

[ 2013-09-10 03:57:55 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | I wonder what she is going to do?
[ 2013-09-10 03:58:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | She's been ignoring for at least a month now.
[ 2013-09-10 03:59:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I checked her Twitter, and it seems she's been going into damage control by tweeting a lot more than she usually does, which is saying something.
[ 2013-09-10 04:00:04 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | The accounts she's following must have increased at least 2000% fold, too.
[ 2013-09-10 04:00:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | We can't just trust a pretty face.

[ 2013-09-10 04:03:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Yeah, this affected me enough earlier that I began to get defensive thoughts against women, mostly girls with sorority-like levels of attractiveness.

Shout to them niggas
Family men, bringing home dinners

Hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone
Kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse
She fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first

[ 2013-09-10 04:07:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I was afraid of all of this. Right as SSSniperWolf called her out, I got the feeling she was a fraud without even watching SSS's video.
[ 2013-09-10 04:07:46 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | what made you think that?
[ 2013-09-10 04:07:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Her vlogs on relationships.
[ 2013-09-10 04:08:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | They were becoming too great in count.
[ 2013-09-10 04:08:20 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Oh yeah
[ 2013-09-10 04:08:28 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | That did kind of get to me as well
[ 2013-09-10 04:08:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | She also didn't post as many commentaries to videos of CoD.
[ 2013-09-10 04:09:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'll admit it: I know this was lust. It wasn't as strong as what I normally go through, but I fell for the sex appeal.
[ 2013-09-10 04:09:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | A girl who games? No way.
[ 2013-09-10 04:10:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | An attractive girl who games? Get out of here.
[ 2013-09-10 04:10:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | As Nas tells me, I need to be careful.
[ 2013-09-10 04:11:18 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | ahh. Speaking of girls, I have to tell you something
[ 2013-09-10 04:11:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Ah. Good news?
[ 2013-09-10 04:11:47 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Well. I texted that girl yesterday to eat dinner
[ 2013-09-10 04:12:06 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | and she accepted
[ 2013-09-10 04:12:54 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | so we went around downtown, ate dinner (naturally, I paid for it), walked through campus at night, drank tea, and went back and hung out with her floormates
[ 2013-09-10 04:12:57 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | that is pretty much
[ 2013-09-10 04:13:07 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | it, but it was more than I asked for so
[ 2013-09-10 04:13:21 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | More than you asked for?
[ 2013-09-10 04:13:33 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | I was expecting less
[ 2013-09-10 04:13:46 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | like.. it went better than I thought it would  go
[ 2013-09-10 04:13:50 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | that is a better phrase
[ 2013-09-10 04:14:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Ah. Great job, man.
[ 2013-09-10 04:14:36 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm thinking about doing it again this weekend
[ 2013-09-10 04:14:46 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | but I don't want to come off as creepy
[ 2013-09-10 04:14:47 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | so
[ 2013-09-10 04:16:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Yeah, I got a girl's number today. We have to introduce ourselves in my particular history section, which is separate from an even bigger lecture class. She introduced herself and said she was into anime, and it went from there. I got it because of the anime club.
[ 2013-09-10 04:17:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | She's going to remind me of the meeting this Thursday.
[ 2013-09-10 04:17:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm not that impressed of myself, though.
[ 2013-09-10 04:17:37 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | why?
[ 2013-09-10 04:17:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I feel like that was driven by lust, too.
[ 2013-09-10 04:20:42 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | so?
[ 2013-09-10 04:21:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | That, and I'm comparing her to sorority girls I see.
[ 2013-09-10 04:21:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | She'd be about a six in my book.
[ 2013-09-10 04:22:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | The lust demonstrates how desperate I am, but I'm not going to let it get the best of me (yet).
[ 2013-09-10 04:22:54 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | By the way, I know I can say this know because he said I can, but I feel like I'm feeling pressure from Tyler's relationship.
[ 2013-09-10 04:23:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I can't do that to myself. I told Josh that if I had to wait until I got out of USC (and South Carolina), then I would.
[ 2013-09-10 04:23:48 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Ahhh so it was Tyler
[ 2013-09-10 04:23:52 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | I knew it
[ 2013-09-10 04:24:20 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | who is he dating?
[ 2013-09-10 04:24:47 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Joy.
[ 2013-09-10 04:24:56 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Called it
[ 2013-09-10 04:24:59 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | callllledd it
[ 2013-09-10 04:25:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm not surprised that Tyler is the first of us to be in a relationship.
[ 2013-09-10 04:25:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I think Karma would have benefitted him the most in this matter.
[ 2013-09-10 04:26:13 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Unlike the rest of us, he never complained to begin with, and I'm proud of him.
[ 2013-09-10 04:26:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm ashamed that I'd even let the pressure get to me even a little bit.<e_m ts="1378787187" a="jalen.benjamin" t="61"/>
[ 2013-09-10 04:27:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'll be back after I brush my teeth.
[ 2013-09-10 04:33:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm back.
[ 2013-09-10 04:42:46 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Welcome back
[ 2013-09-10 04:49:23 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Damn it. I'm so stubborn. This girl, in terms of appearance, is only one point lower than what I require. Lol.
[ 2013-09-10 04:53:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm going to bed, Edward. Good night, man.
[ 2013-09-10 04:53:59 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | gnight
[ 2013-09-11 03:48:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Hey, man.
[ 2013-09-11 03:48:53 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Hey
[ 2013-09-11 03:48:57 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | got your text
[ 2013-09-11 03:48:59 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | great job man
[ 2013-09-11 03:49:21 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Thank you.
[ 2013-09-11 03:49:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm trying to not make a big deal about it, but I am excited.
[ 2013-09-11 03:49:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | All I want to do is take a girl out to dinner.
[ 2013-09-11 03:49:52 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Lol.. you are excited about as much I was excited about it
[ 2013-09-11 03:50:15 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Taking a girl out to dinner is just one of the many joys in life. I figured that out pretty quickly
[ 2013-09-11 03:50:21 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | good luck on your expeditions man
[ 2013-09-11 03:51:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Thank you again. Here's to hoping she doesn't have a boyfriend. That can throw a wrench in things even if it's just dinner that I'm paying for the both of us.
[ 2013-09-11 03:51:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm not sure yet.
[ 2013-09-11 03:52:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I could feel my eyes light up as she said she wanted to walk back with me.
[ 2013-09-11 03:52:23 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | The conversation was going well, and I just had to do something.
[ 2013-09-11 03:52:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I didn't even think about it for 30 seconds. I knew I was going to ask her for her number.
[ 2013-09-11 03:53:32 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Let's see how far this takes us eh?
[ 2013-09-11 03:53:36 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm kind of curious
[ 2013-09-11 03:54:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | She's cute~
[ 2013-09-11 03:54:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | From a physical standpoint, she's perfect.
[ 2013-09-11 03:54:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | She doesn't overwhelm me with her beauty. It's at about what I consider to be a 7.
[ 2013-09-11 03:54:55 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | 7s, in my opinion, are perfect matches for me.
[ 2013-09-11 03:55:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Usuaully, their personalities aren't seemingly as bad as 9s or higher.
[ 2013-09-11 03:55:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | She also has this alternative vib about her.
[ 2013-09-11 03:56:10 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | She talks in this manner that makes me think she's a little into goth or scene culture, and she has small guages in her ears to show it.
[ 2013-09-11 04:00:14 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Even if I don't make it far, I definitely want you, too.
[ 2013-09-11 04:00:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm going to keep trying for a while. There are so many attractive girls in SSA (at least those that were at the meeting) that it's crazy.
[ 2013-09-11 04:01:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | A senior I talked to talked to me of her own will, and I almost got her number, too.
[ 2013-09-11 04:01:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | She lives on campus, but I decided to not go for it since she's a senior.
[ 2013-09-11 04:01:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | That situation with her happened before the second girl who I've already described.
[ 2013-09-11 04:02:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | It's awesome that her favorite game is Super Smash Bros. Melee, though.
[ 2013-09-11 04:02:39 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Iti s my favorite game as well.
[ 2013-09-11 04:04:07 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Nice nice
[ 2013-09-11 04:04:13 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | hitting a streak i see
[ 2013-09-11 04:04:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | If this doesn't work, I might go after the senior anyway. Essentially, she'd be the only one that I'd have a chance with.
[ 2013-09-11 04:05:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I even flirted with her a bit and told her she needed to play me in Melee and that I'd help her understand the tier lists and the mechanics of the game.
[ 2013-09-11 04:06:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I got comfortable talking with her that we discussed our romantic interests in people outside of our race.
[ 2013-09-11 04:06:47 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | And even though I didn't get her number, I hinted that I wanted to keep talking to her via Facebook, so I'm reactivating that by tomorrow.
[ 2013-09-11 04:06:54 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I have to for meetings anyway, but it's fine.
[ 2013-09-11 04:07:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | No bravado. I just want a pretty lady to pay attention to me.
[ 2013-09-11 04:09:58 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Lol nice nice
[ 2013-09-11 04:10:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Oh, man, even though I said I didn't care, the want for love is strong.
[ 2013-09-11 04:10:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | That dopamine rush felt so good.
[ 2013-09-11 04:11:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Sure, I was nervous, but I kept my composure. The small talk wasn't as bad as it normally is because we're essentially a bunch of nerds and geeks.
[ 2013-09-11 04:12:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I just want to take someone out to dinner. Lol.
[ 2013-09-11 04:14:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | If any woman accepts me, I'll be sure to be humble and let her know that she's my first love.
[ 2013-09-11 04:15:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm not perfect, and I'm already a little irked that I still can't drive without someone who's over 21 in the vehicle.
[ 2013-09-11 04:15:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Driving around might be important for this.
[ 2013-09-11 04:16:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | That's why we need to be as nice as possible, Edward. We have to make sure the women who are interested in us believe that our flaws are few and far in between.
[ 2013-09-11 04:17:03 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Very true.
[ 2013-09-11 04:17:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Not having a car on campus might be a flaw in some people's eyes, not just girls, but I'm going to do all I can.
[ 2013-09-11 04:18:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm willing to lose over an hour of sleep a night just to let my love interest know I'm there for her.
[ 2013-09-11 04:19:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm such a hypocrite. I do care. I do care. I do care. I do care. I do care. I do care. I do care. I do care. I do care. I do care.
[ 2013-09-11 04:21:20 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | I care alot as well
[ 2013-09-11 04:21:25 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | don't worry you are not alone
[ 2013-09-11 04:21:30 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | I have alot hanging for me as well
[ 2013-09-11 04:21:35 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | bugs me everyday
[ 2013-09-11 04:22:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm praying for you, man. If anything, I want to see all of you succeed over myself.
[ 2013-09-11 04:22:31 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Aww man. Don't be like that. I want you to succeed as well
[ 2013-09-11 04:22:37 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm rooting for you man
[ 2013-09-11 04:22:43 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Let's try our best
[ 2013-09-11 04:23:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Definitely. I have over 15 girls to choose from as well, but I know some of them have boyfriends and the like.
[ 2013-09-11 04:24:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm going to have to move quickly to the next one in case I do fail. We have a party coming up next Saturday, so that will be one of my chances in case the girl I'm currently seeking the attention of doesn't requite my love. XD<e_m ts="1378873471" a="jalen.benjamin" t="61"/>
[ 2013-09-11 04:27:54 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I love that alternative feeling about her, though. She probably listens to metal. &lt;3 <ss type="heart">(heart)</ss><e_m ts="1378873674" a="jalen.benjamin" t="61"/>
[ 2013-09-11 04:29:32 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | aww yeahh
[ 2013-09-11 04:30:10 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'll be quiet about this for now. I'm going to remain (seemingly) calm.
[ 2013-09-11 04:33:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Ah, one more thing. She's vegan, but I have no problem with it.
[ 2013-09-11 04:35:44 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Yeah who cares about vegan lol
[ 2013-09-11 04:44:46 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'll make sure to take her to a restaurant with vergan and vegetarian options if the time arises.
[ 2013-09-11 04:44:54 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Anyway, what have you been up to, my man?

[ 2013-09-11 18:03:56 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lucky.  I have another 2 weeks till my first exam
[ 2013-09-11 18:05:19 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | What's exams do you have?
[ 2013-09-11 18:06:03 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | calc and bio e

[ 2013-09-11 18:07:14 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | idk why you'd guess that.  you haven't had either.
[ 2013-09-11 18:08:24 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | People told me calc 3 was easy and bio e seems easy because it is called bio easy
[ 2013-09-11 18:09:04 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | O.O  it's not called bio easy.
[ 2013-08-22 01:16:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Nothing much at the moment.
[ 2013-08-22 01:16:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Did you watch the part of the video I sent?
[ 2013-08-22 01:20:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | At least they are related to your major.
[ 2013-08-22 01:23:48 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Wow, I couldn't do this at all.
[ 2013-08-22 01:26:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Wow...
[ 2013-08-22 01:27:48 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I know that feeling.
[ 2013-08-22 01:29:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Sigh, Columbia is just a big disappointment, though.
[ 2013-08-22 01:29:32 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I have no idea what to do about this.
[ 2013-08-22 01:33:10 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | So, you wouldn't be able to get these jobs by earning credit hours and passsing courses?
[ 2013-08-22 01:34:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Fml.
[ 2013-08-22 01:36:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Until I get some experience, I can feel nothing but apathy for this university and its people.
[ 2013-08-22 01:36:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | South Carolina just isn't New York State or California.
[ 2013-08-22 01:37:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That is where most of my jobs are.
[ 2013-08-22 01:38:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'll be right back. I'm going to take a quick shower.
[ 2013-08-22 01:55:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm back.
[ 2013-08-22 02:39:10 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Hi
[ 2013-08-22 02:39:22 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Sorry. I had to call somebody
[ 2013-08-22 02:39:39 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It's fine.
[ 2013-08-22 02:40:30 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Yeah. The jobs I am looking at take too much time
[ 2013-08-22 02:40:40 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I might have to settle with a library job
[ 2013-08-22 02:40:39 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | sigh
[ 2013-08-22 02:42:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That really bites.
[ 2013-08-22 02:43:27 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Shit
[ 2013-08-22 02:43:39 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Whatever that leaves me more time to develop our own project lol
[ 2013-08-22 02:44:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | There is that. Lol.
[ 2013-08-22 02:49:54 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | So, how did you like that level 75 Garchomp?
[ 2013-08-22 03:49:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'll see you later, Edward.
[ 2013-08-22 03:49:13 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm heading off to bed.
[ 2013-08-22 03:49:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Good night.
[ 2013-08-22 20:15:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Yo, Edward, I'm done with class for the day.
[ 2013-08-22 20:24:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Alas, I know that once we're both in school and we have (home)work, we won't be able to talk as much until the weekends.
[ 2013-08-22 20:26:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | As I thought, I saw Abbey and Jamie sure enough. We share a class together, but I didn't give it much thought.
[ 2013-08-22 20:26:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I consider our shared memories last year to have been false anyway.
[ 2013-08-22 20:27:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm just going to go hard with my work. Almost everyone else can leave me alone if they want.
[ 2013-08-22 21:52:55 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Wow I just got your messages
[ 2013-08-22 21:53:03 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Skype pisses me off sometimes
[ 2013-08-22 21:53:18 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | But I know what mean man.
[ 2013-08-22 21:53:30 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Do you have any classes tomorrow afternoon?
[ 2013-08-22 21:53:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I only have one. It begins at 12 and ends around 1.
[ 2013-08-22 21:54:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I love my Fridays. It makes those two Saturday field trips I have to go on throughout the semester worth it.
[ 2013-08-22 21:54:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | The impression I get from my classes so far is that I like them, and I don't think I'd want to have a job because of how long my science class' lab is.
[ 2013-08-22 21:54:54 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | They are field trips after all.
[ 2013-08-22 21:57:20 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm not thinking about it too much, but I could see it in Abbey's eyes and hear it ever so slightly in her voice that she remembers everything. Lol.
[ 2013-08-22 21:57:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It's as if she is ever so slightly flirting with me, but only I and maybe Jamie would be aware of it.
[ 2013-08-22 21:57:55 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Ah well. Everything's everything.
[ 2013-08-22 21:58:55 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Yep.
[ 2013-08-22 21:59:13 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | But if things go well, I can come over to USC around that time.
[ 2013-08-22 21:59:34 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | And maybe we could meet up duing that time
[ 2013-08-22 22:08:08 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It'd be nice to see you one last time before you go.
[ 2013-08-22 22:08:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Sigh, I don't know. I feel like working during the school year might be a little overrated at this point.
[ 2013-08-22 22:09:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I felt exhausted walking from class to class because of the humidity.
[ 2013-08-22 22:09:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | My lower didn't get that hot even though I'm wearing pants.
[ 2013-08-22 22:09:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | My upper body got to me today.
[ 2013-08-22 22:09:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I had to carry some water on me after my first class.
[ 2013-08-22 22:10:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It's ridiculous thinking about how much water we waste just traversing from class to class.
[ 2013-08-22 22:10:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That can't be good for the environment.
[ 2013-08-22 22:11:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I can't stop listening to Horrorcore either.
[ 2013-08-22 22:12:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | This is not good.
[ 2013-08-22 22:15:54 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It's all good
[ 2013-08-22 22:16:17 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm listening alot more extreme metal lately
[ 2013-08-22 22:17:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm slowly getting into more Machine Gun Kelly and Dark Man X. Luckily, they have two songs together, one on either of their newest albums.
[ 2013-08-22 22:18:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | &quot;D3mons&quot; is one. It has some incoherent, haunting background vocals.
[ 2013-08-22 22:28:13 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Yep. We just need to get our minds off everything bad whether at USCor anywhere else
[ 2013-08-22 22:41:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | As Shofu once said (many times to this day), &quot;We don't love these hos.&quot;
[ 2013-08-22 22:41:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Jalen: &quot;Comen, Shofu...&quot;
[ 2013-08-22 22:41:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Shofu: &quot;No~&quot;
[ 2013-08-22 22:47:47 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Lol
[ 2013-08-22 22:49:04 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Did you see that video I sent? Lol.
[ 2013-08-22 22:49:04 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I love Shofu, his brother, and their friends. XD

[ 2013-08-22 22:49:44 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I think my wireless card is damaged

[ 2013-08-22 22:50:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Something tells me that girls make that's what he said jokes.
[ 2013-08-22 22:50:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Anyway, their reaction to that level 75 Garchomp was hilarious.
[ 2013-08-22 22:51:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I went from shock in reaction to the Garchomp to hysteria at their own shock.
[ 2013-08-22 22:51:21 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | And then, the Medicham and the sensei... Wow.
[ 2013-08-22 22:53:05 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Lol ikr

[ 2013-08-22 22:56:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I can see why a Chromebook would be so convenient to you right now.
[ 2013-08-22 22:58:20 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Oh, speaking of women, I saw so many blonds today that looked quite similar.
[ 2013-08-22 22:58:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That must happen when you don't see people for months at a time.
[ 2013-08-22 23:02:59 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Lol yup

[ 2013-08-22 23:10:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | They smell so good, too.
[ 2013-08-22 23:11:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I have to walk by the mostly girl part of my floor every day, and it smells like perfume with a light banana scent.
[ 2013-08-22 23:11:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That's a lot of prep time. Wow.
[ 2013-08-22 23:13:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Earlier, I thought, &quot;These white girls would never pay me attention because they probably think I wouldn't do the same.&quot;
[ 2013-08-22 23:13:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That's when I was actually feeling a little uneasy being the only minority in one of my classes.
[ 2013-08-22 23:14:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | But then, I stopped thinking about it because it's probably just a self-fufilling prophecy.
[ 2013-08-22 23:14:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Besides, there are a lot of respectable guys of any ethnic background some of these girls wouldn't pay attention to.
[ 2013-08-22 23:14:56 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Everything's everything.
[ 2013-08-22 23:16:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'll switch to my iPad. I just remembered that Kyle wanted to see me later. Comment and possibly shower me with your mad Based power skillz if you disagree.
[ 2013-08-22 23:21:43 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | No actually I agree

[ 2013-08-22 23:25:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That made no sense. XD
[ 2013-08-22 23:26:00 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Jalen we have to play saints row 4 together at some point
[ 2013-08-22 23:26:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Definitely.
[ 2013-08-22 23:27:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | On the topic of MGK and Twista, 1. MGK has a song with M. Shadows and Synyster Gates on his album &quot;Lace Up,&quot; and 2. Twista is underrated as a chopper style rapper.
[ 2013-08-22 23:31:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | All I need are some punk, metal, and/or goth girls, and I'm set for this weekend.

[ 2013-08-22 23:51:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | This one of the few times where the demons wouldn't have to yell at me as much.
[ 2013-08-22 23:51:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | D3mons: &quot;Just do it already.&quot;

[ 2013-08-22 23:54:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I believe JT said he had to change his schedule again because USC gave him a class with prerequisites.
[ 2013-08-22 23:54:56 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Even so, I don't most of the offices would be open at this time.
[ 2013-08-22 23:55:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | He could be watching anime or the like because of how bad the internet is.
[ 2013-08-22 23:55:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Speaking of which, by 9, I will start on SAO.

[ 2013-08-22 23:59:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | As far as I know, it hasn't changed since he last showed it.
[ 2013-08-23 00:16:06 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Damn it Josh
[ 2013-08-23 00:28:08 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Maybe we should get organized about this
[ 2013-08-23 00:45:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | There isn't much we can do if Josh isn't here.
[ 2013-08-23 00:45:49 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Yeah
[ 2013-08-23 00:46:01 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I might make a code repository just for us
[ 2013-08-23 00:46:07 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | a git server
[ 2013-08-23 01:07:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I didn't mean the sudden silence.
[ 2013-08-23 01:07:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm just registering for the online portion of my history course.
[ 2013-08-23 02:01:46 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Its k man
[ 2013-08-23 02:02:12 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm just talking to some juniors
[ 2013-08-23 02:10:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Women, ka?
[ 2013-08-23 02:30:42 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | lol no
[ 2013-08-23 02:30:49 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm not based like you
[ 2013-08-23 02:31:16 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | If by Based, you mean &quot;Based off of nothing,&quot; then you are right.
[ 2013-08-23 02:31:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I am a figurative zero.
[ 2013-08-23 03:38:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | iWin again it seems. No retort yet again. \m/
[ 2013-08-23 03:38:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Anyway, Josh already hates Ubuntu.
[ 2013-08-23 03:38:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Talk about world records.
[ 2013-08-23 03:39:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm also listening to hard rock/alternative metal music for the first time in days because of all that Aqualeo I've been listening to.
[ 2013-08-23 04:21:47 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | So josh hates Ubuntu
[ 2013-08-23 04:21:49 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | NOOOOOOO
[ 2013-08-23 04:21:54 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | oh well his choice
[ 2013-08-23 04:22:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It was so quick, too. XD
[ 2013-08-23 04:22:42 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Damn.. he hated unity
[ 2013-08-23 04:22:46 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I liked it personally
[ 2013-08-23 04:22:58 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I think I got too heated over the terminal debate as well
[ 2013-08-23 04:23:09 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | fuck my temper
[ 2013-08-23 04:23:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Lol. I didn't understand what you two were saying half the time, so I couldn't tell that well.
[ 2013-08-23 04:24:02 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Yeah. It was just me saying jargon
[ 2013-08-23 04:24:15 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Oh well. I personally love the terminal
[ 2013-08-23 04:24:23 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I can't live without it
[ 2013-08-23 04:24:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I sure hope Josh takes this seriously.
[ 2013-08-23 04:24:48 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | He already has to start right from the beginning.
[ 2013-08-23 04:25:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | He's technically a freshman again if what he told me is correct.
[ 2013-08-23 04:25:11 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Really?
[ 2013-08-23 04:25:13 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | wow
[ 2013-08-23 04:25:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Yeah, he's starting near the beginning again.
[ 2013-08-23 04:26:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | He has a few electives, but it doesn't matter that much. He has to make up for that main coursework.
[ 2013-08-23 04:26:22 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Oh shit. Good Luck Josh
[ 2013-08-23 04:27:04 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | He could lose some of his scholarships his fifth year. I wonder what he's going to do if he does have to stay for four more years.
[ 2013-08-23 04:27:24 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I mean if he takes more of his core classes, he shouldn't have that problem
[ 2013-08-23 04:29:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It's not so much that he hated Unity. He disliked Linux.
[ 2013-08-23 04:30:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | After Windows 7, the only other OS that people would use is OS X.
[ 2013-08-23 04:30:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It's the *only* one.
[ 2013-08-23 04:34:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | You need to tell him that. Seriously.
[ 2013-08-23 04:35:04 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That's moronic. Even I know otherwise.
[ 2013-08-23 04:35:14 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Oh, great, here comes a repeat of last year.
[ 2013-08-23 04:36:32 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Certainly, if he realizes that to install Flash in third party browsers like Midori through the termial, he'll see that.
[ 2013-08-23 04:36:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | And using Wine?
[ 2013-08-23 04:36:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Lmao.
[ 2013-08-23 04:37:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Something is wrong about a computer science major wanting to use Wine so readily.
[ 2013-08-23 04:37:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | He's going to be using Linux through his four years, isn't he?
[ 2013-08-23 04:38:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | He sounded as if he only had to worry about it for the first half of this semester.
[ 2013-08-23 04:38:14 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Way off.
[ 2013-08-23 04:31:40 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Disliked Linux
[ 2013-08-23 04:31:57 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Well.. I don't know how is going to get away with that
[ 2013-08-23 04:32:09 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | but we shall see
[ 2013-08-23 04:33:12 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I mean it's ok if he dislikes linux
[ 2013-08-23 04:33:26 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | but many people expect him to be fluent in linux
[ 2013-08-23 04:33:39 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | b/c if he really is going to be server mangagement and such
[ 2013-08-23 04:33:43 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | guess what
[ 2013-08-23 04:33:48 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | the server is probably going to run linux
[ 2013-08-23 04:34:01 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | and also guess what, he is going to be using the terminal
[ 2013-08-23 04:34:07 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | alot.... ALOT
[ 2013-08-23 04:34:42 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Yeah, but did you see my argument with him about the terminal. he said it was useless
[ 2013-08-23 04:34:48 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I can't convince him otherwise
[ 2013-08-23 04:35:32 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Jalen, you are a moderate linux user, maybe you can convince him
[ 2013-08-23 04:35:42 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | and he listens to you more than he does to me
[ 2013-08-23 04:40:13 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Its not just his half semester
[ 2013-08-23 04:40:21 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | its his career
[ 2013-08-23 04:40:27 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | its his skill set
[ 2013-08-23 04:41:54 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Yeah. Lol, its kind of ironic that you know more than him when it comes to linux
[ 2013-08-23 04:41:59 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | and love it more than he does
[ 2013-08-23 04:42:08 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | even though he is the comp sci major
[ 2013-08-23 04:42:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Josh is in a bad spot here because if he drops computer science, what else does he have to turn to?
[ 2013-08-23 04:43:16 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | You and JT need to set him straight soon.
[ 2013-08-23 04:43:40 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Yeah. Actually, I'm a little worried about JT as well.
[ 2013-08-23 04:44:00 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Somebody I wonder what he learned in that linux class
[ 2013-08-23 04:44:20 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That one time he installed minecraft as root kind of scared me
[ 2013-08-23 04:45:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | So, you're saying that most computer science majors should already be familiar with basic terminal access and installing unlike JT and Josh?
[ 2013-08-23 04:45:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I wasn't aware that Lacie used Linux before last year, but she seems to be doing well.
[ 2013-08-23 04:46:30 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Well no. But I am saying that alot of comp sci majors have a passion for their subject
[ 2013-08-23 04:46:39 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Their love with linux,programming, etc just shows passion
[ 2013-08-23 04:47:09 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Jt shows passion for hacking. I respect that
[ 2013-08-23 04:47:23 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | But you don't need a comp sci degree to learn how to hack and game
[ 2013-08-23 04:47:45 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | and you don't need a comp sci degree to game, period.
[ 2013-08-23 04:48:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Let's hope gaming doesn't get in the way for them.
[ 2013-08-23 04:48:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Honestly, I don't know why they're not talking to Lacie or Karl more.
[ 2013-08-23 04:49:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | If someone I knew from Governor's School aspired to be a journalist, I'd certainly talk to them more - unless I hated them, of course.
[ 2013-08-23 04:49:47 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I have no idea to tell you the truth. I don't think Josh is fond of Schober at all.
[ 2013-08-23 04:49:56 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I thought he looked cool
[ 2013-08-23 04:50:04 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | and damn I wish I talked to him more
[ 2013-08-23 04:50:36 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | but one thing is for certain
[ 2013-08-23 04:50:39 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I hope they love math.
[ 2013-08-23 04:51:00 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | b/c advanced comp sci is pretty much math
[ 2013-08-23 04:51:24 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | you can see that through history. All influenetial comp scientists were also mathematicans
[ 2013-08-23 04:51:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Josh and JT weren't that great at math in Governor's School. Lol.
[ 2013-08-23 04:51:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | And speaking of Karl, I have no problem with him at all.
[ 2013-08-23 04:52:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I don't know what the hell Josh's problem is.
[ 2013-08-23 04:52:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | The days of Karl tagging up with Preston and Tom are over.
[ 2013-08-23 04:53:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | As far as I'm concerned, I think it more had to do with jealousy rather than something Karl directly did.
[ 2013-08-23 04:53:51 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I have no clue what happened between them. I wasn't at g school that year
[ 2013-08-23 04:54:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Karl is quite cool. On the surface, he has no dislike for anyone. I consider him to be a nicer person than I am.
[ 2013-08-23 04:55:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm very deceiving. I know that. I don't know if he is, but I don't think that.
[ 2013-08-23 04:57:20 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Darn. I think what Josh told me about Karl made me reluctant to talk to him
[ 2013-08-23 04:57:22 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | fack
[ 2013-08-23 04:57:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I wish I had known that. Even if I would have told you not to pay attention to him.
[ 2013-08-23 04:58:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I honestly don't remember what it was, but I feel like it's all moronic now.
[ 2013-08-23 04:58:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I should probably feel that way about my own frenemies, and I have done better than Josh already. Lol.
[ 2013-08-23 05:01:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I don't want to talk to Jamie for example, but if she wants to talk to me, then fine. I'll probably become more willing to talk to her - as an acquaintance.
[ 2013-08-23 05:06:29 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Yeah, I know what you mean. I feel like I should have talked to Lacie and Karl more.
[ 2013-08-23 05:06:46 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Actually during Colloquium, I talked to Preston
[ 2013-08-23 05:06:51 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | and he sounded nice and cool
[ 2013-08-23 05:07:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Josh might have taken it too seriously I suppose because I'm okay with Tom and Preston as well.
[ 2013-08-23 05:08:21 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Honestly, I would think Josh would be bitter at John Rosemeyer because of how he gave us all the cold shoulder.
[ 2013-08-23 05:08:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | He probably is, but he's never said anything about it since our senior year.
[ 2013-08-23 05:09:02 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I remember that. It happened ever since he started to hang out with Tibbs.
[ 2013-08-23 05:09:12 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That was some weird stuff
[ 2013-08-23 05:09:55 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | And when he went after Megan and Zoey.
[ 2013-08-23 05:10:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I still don't like Zoey either, and I'm glad she didn't come here.
[ 2013-08-23 05:10:35 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Oh god.
[ 2013-08-23 05:10:38 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Zoey
[ 2013-08-23 05:10:50 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Remember what happened between me and her?
[ 2013-08-23 05:11:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Yeah.
[ 2013-08-23 05:11:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Did we ever tell Josh it was you?
[ 2013-08-23 05:11:20 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | No
[ 2013-08-23 05:11:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I wonder how he still feels about that.
[ 2013-08-23 05:11:39 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | He would have been FURIOUS
[ 2013-08-23 05:11:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I honestly want her to stay away.
[ 2013-08-23 05:11:55 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Yeah, if Josh even finds that out now, he'd be hurt.
[ 2013-08-23 05:12:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I remember he said that friends wouldn't let friends hide important things like this from each other, so I felt that I was also to blame.
[ 2013-08-23 05:12:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That's essentially what he was saying.
[ 2013-08-23 05:13:05 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Yup. I intended to never let him figure out about it
[ 2013-08-23 05:13:11 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I really don't need that
[ 2013-08-23 05:14:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I know he still knows that I know, though.
[ 2013-08-23 05:14:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | At this point, I think he suspects that it's you.
[ 2013-08-23 05:14:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | JT doesn't know who she is.
[ 2013-08-23 05:15:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'd instantly say it was John or anyone else outside our group after it go that bad.
[ 2013-08-23 05:15:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Tyler would never do that to Josh.
[ 2013-08-23 05:15:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It's either me or you. That's who he was probably thinking about.
[ 2013-08-23 05:16:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Honestly, I don't care about Zoe. If she were a guy, I'd probably get someone to punch her for me.

[ 2013-08-23 05:17:46 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | He would have called on me a long time ago
[ 2013-08-23 05:18:14 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It could be something he's sorted out with his counselor, which is a great thing in his case.
[ 2013-08-23 05:18:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm certain he had to talk to him about Julia as well.
[ 2013-08-23 05:18:48 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I can't be mad at him if he thought I turned my back on him.
[ 2013-08-23 05:18:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | We were and still sort of are in the same boat.
[ 2013-08-23 05:19:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I mean, I wonder how I'd feel if one of my best friends turned his or her back on me because of someone else.
[ 2013-08-23 05:19:53 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That's what I did to him.
[ 2013-08-23 05:20:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That's not even something I've confronted yet whether personally or with my counselor.

[ 2013-08-23 05:22:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | From a karma standpoint, I can see why some of that torment last year happened. Not all of it by a long shot, but the universe or whatever force wasn't going to let Josh shoulder all that pain by himself.
[ 2013-08-23 05:23:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It depends. The next time he ever talks about Zoe (and possibly Julia), it might come out.
[ 2013-08-23 05:23:40 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Awh shit
[ 2013-08-23 05:23:44 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Not good.
[ 2013-08-23 05:24:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I've taken most of the damage in his eyes.
[ 2013-08-23 05:24:47 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | When I think back to waht Lydia said to me last year about how Josh complained I wasn't on Skype, what else was he thinking about me?
[ 2013-08-23 05:25:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | In those months, he could have really thought it was me, but he never said anything.
[ 2013-08-23 05:26:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Well, at least he is better now. I don't know what to think.
[ 2013-08-23 05:26:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | He hasn't talked about Julia or Zoe in a while, so to bring it up could mean trouble.
[ 2013-08-23 05:27:27 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Im not going to bring it up ever
[ 2013-08-23 05:27:41 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Fuck that. Dead things need to stay dead.

[ 2013-08-23 05:28:24 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Is it possible that Tyler told Josh about it already?
[ 2013-08-23 05:28:38 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I remember you telling Tyler the truth.
[ 2013-08-23 05:29:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I think so.
[ 2013-08-23 05:29:22 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | awww fuck
[ 2013-08-23 05:29:56 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | At least he hasn't gotten upset or blocked you anywhere. I think of this as surviving in my book.
[ 2013-08-23 05:30:16 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I think he realizes Zoe was more bad that good and was trying to play the both of you.
[ 2013-08-23 05:30:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | She's at fault. Not you two.
[ 2013-08-23 05:30:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Josh should have left her alone like Tyler and I told him, though.
[ 2013-08-23 05:31:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm sure that one encounter he had with her won't be his best experience with women.
[ 2013-08-23 05:31:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It's a bitter note to go out on.
[ 2013-08-23 05:32:00 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Oh no. Some of the things g school girls did
[ 2013-08-23 05:32:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Lol.
[ 2013-08-23 05:32:47 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Everything's everything.
[ 2013-08-23 05:33:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | After that experience, I saw why it's best to let women go after guys than the vice versa. Lol.
[ 2013-08-23 05:33:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That's why I don't fret nearly as much as I did junior year.
[ 2013-08-23 05:34:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Being single can be a gift.
[ 2013-08-23 05:35:05 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I suppose it can. G school memories really get to me sometimes though
[ 2013-08-23 05:35:16 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | They still do
[ 2013-08-23 05:36:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I don't see the point in going to my 10th year reunion because of that. I don't want to associate myself with some of that crowd anymore.
[ 2013-08-23 05:36:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I feel liberated.
[ 2013-08-23 05:37:14 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I actually really stopped caring about my mishappenings with girls back then because I saw it was happening to other people like Josh and JT.
[ 2013-08-23 05:37:36 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Oh yup. Pretty shitty experiences they have had
[ 2013-08-23 05:38:31 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Still don't know what happened with JT all that well. I think it is over now.
[ 2013-08-23 05:38:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | There was Allison, and then there was Lydia essentially.
[ 2013-08-23 05:40:15 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Well.. I hope the Lydia incident is over with

[ 2013-08-23 05:41:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Even I don't give that much of a care about her anymore.
[ 2013-08-23 05:44:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | To any normal straight male in this situation I'd say, &quot;Man, just look forward to having a woman that wants you or casual, protected sex. Until then, cherish going solo. Trust me. People on Reddit say sex can be quite unfilling. Take care, my brother. \m/ (&quot;Straaaaaange Music&quot; blares out of nowhere)&quot;
[ 2013-08-23 05:47:47 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | In less than two years, my thoughts about Lydia have gone from, &quot;What have I done wrong?&quot; to &quot;How do I get over this?&quot; to &quot;Does she still dislike to me?&quot; to &quot;What is JT doing?&quot; to &quot;Oh no.&quot; to &quot;Nooooo!&quot; to &quot;Okay then.&quot; to &quot;Good.&quot; to &quot;Finally.&quot; to &quot;Will I experience love?&quot; to &quot;Not again.

[ 2013-08-23 05:49:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I will admit here, and even if she would back me up and agree (but only in a joking way :/), I'd bang my female best friend.
[ 2013-08-23 05:50:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I have at least three of them, but the one I'm closest to is definitely the one I wouldn't mind having casual sex with at all.
[ 2013-08-23 05:50:32 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I could tell that to her face, and we wouldn't flinch.
[ 2013-08-23 05:50:40 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Oh wow
[ 2013-08-23 05:50:48 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | quite the friendship
[ 2013-08-23 05:51:04 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I would think that would be a relationship breaker
[ 2013-08-23 05:51:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It use to make me quite sad - and confused.
[ 2013-08-23 05:51:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | She's French with these gorgeous yellowish brown eyes.
[ 2013-08-23 05:51:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I have literally never seen anyone else with these eyes.

[ 2013-08-23 05:52:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That was my second worst experience with the friend zone.
[ 2013-08-23 05:53:05 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Lol
[ 2013-08-23 05:53:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | She's pretty much what I want in a girl to this day, but everything's everything.
[ 2013-08-23 05:53:54 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | She makes fun of me for still being a virgin, and the next time she says that, Jalen is going to say: &quot;Let's do it then. I know you have condoms.&quot;
[ 2013-08-23 05:54:13 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Even I would die.

[ 2013-08-23 05:55:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | She tells me about her sex life.

[ 2013-08-23 05:56:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I honestly wouldn't be surprised if we got married, and I'm not saying that out of lust.
[ 2013-08-23 05:57:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm saying that because of how for a relationship with a guy and a girl that's not romantic that we talk about sex.
[ 2013-08-23 05:57:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It's as if we're bickering about each other's sex lives.
[ 2013-08-23 05:58:35 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Lol. Jalen.. to have a girl openly talk about her sex life to you
[ 2013-08-23 05:58:40 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | That is pretty based
[ 2013-08-23 05:58:51 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | and I don't even mean that in a joking way

[ 2013-08-23 06:01:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | There were times where I didn't want to be around at her at all.
[ 2013-08-23 06:01:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | It happens every so often, and it happened this summer, but then I try to think of her as a friend and not necessarily as a woman.
[ 2013-08-23 06:01:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I realize it then that she's worth it.
[ 2013-08-23 06:02:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | She's never been mean to me, and she's like an older sister.
[ 2013-08-23 06:02:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Considering that she's 11 months older than me, I can see why she wouldn't want to date me.
[ 2013-08-23 06:02:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | I'm not saying women's rules about dating older men are fair per se, but everything's everything.

[ 2013-08-23 06:03:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | Half-facetiously and half-seriously, I know she wants me to succeed at courting someone. I think she'd go crazy if I turned 35 and never dated or have sex.

[ 2013-08-23 06:04:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Nothing much at the moment. | She told me before that she was going to take me to a strip club one by the time that ever happened...

[ 2013-09-12 03:46:33 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | fuck
[ 2013-09-12 03:47:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | What I'm doing is limiting myself to once a week (at least no more than twice a week) where I ask my interest if she's interested in going with me somewhere.
[ 2013-09-12 03:48:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I wouldn't mind hanging out Friday and Saturday, and then, I'd want one week to do it all over again.
[ 2013-09-12 03:49:36 ] Sender: Zach Goldstein | | Hey | Hey, do you have a partner or the hog project?

[ 2013-09-12 03:52:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Mhmm. I also felt that if any of us were to get past the third date/get together, then it'd be appropriate to ask the girl out.
[ 2013-09-12 03:52:38 ] Sent to: zachgoldstein95 From Edward Kim | | Hey | How are we going to do this?
[ 2013-09-12 03:52:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | For now, I'll stick with getting coffee. Then, I'll move to food if I do well.
[ 2013-09-12 03:53:18 ] Sender: Zach Goldstein | | Hey | Sweet. I've got nothing going on tomorrow except for a cs discussion at 12:30 (goes til 2), so I'm good to meet up whenever besides then
[ 2013-09-12 03:53:41 ] Sender: Zach Goldstein | | Hey | I can bring my laptop to your place, if that's best
[ 2013-09-12 03:54:06 ] Sent to: zachgoldstein95 From Edward Kim | | Hey | Yeah dude. That seems awesome. I'm free after 9:30am until 3:30
[ 2013-09-12 03:54:44 ] Sender: Zach Goldstein | | Hey | Sweet, how about I meet you around 10?
[ 2013-09-12 03:54:52 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Alright. I'm thinking about brginging my interest to a portion of town where there is alot of food

[ 2013-09-12 03:55:14 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Btw what is your date's name?
[ 2013-09-12 03:57:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Ambyr. How about yours?
[ 2013-09-12 03:58:08 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | By the way, you're in the clear, man. I still don't know if she has a boyfriend or not.
[ 2013-09-12 03:58:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'll know that by Saturday (depending on if I get the chance to take her for coffee by then).
[ 2013-09-12 03:58:29 ] Sender: Zach Goldstein | | Hey | Awesome. What's your hall?
[ 2013-09-12 03:59:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | And by the way, it is spelled with a y. I like names with unique spellings.<e_m ts="1378958350" a="jalen.benjamin" t="61"/>
[ 2013-09-12 03:59:14 ] Sent to: zachgoldstein95 From Edward Kim | | Hey | Ehrman #407

[ 2013-09-12 04:00:01 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Pray to god that she doesn't have a bf
[ 2013-09-12 04:00:37 ] Sender: Zach Goldstein | | Hey | Awesome, I'll see you tomorrow
[ 2013-09-12 04:00:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | If not, then I'm off the hook. I'd have to wait until next week to see who else might be interested.
[ 2013-09-12 04:00:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | It's no big deal.
[ 2013-09-12 04:01:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | While I'm ready to deal with her veganism, I know if it doesn't work out, the next girl isn't likely to be one.
[ 2013-09-12 04:02:39 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm only going to go after five girls or so, though. If nothing happens after that time, then I feel like it's not my time.
[ 2013-09-12 04:03:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I want to have better experiences than I even had with Abbey, whether they are failures or successes. That's really saying something considering that was the best experience I've ever had with a girl.
[ 2013-09-12 04:05:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'm tired of writing anonymous love notes (yes, that means I wrote more than one XD).
[ 2013-09-12 04:06:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | If Abbey made me feel like a man, then I should come out of these possible rejections feeling like a god.
[ 2013-09-12 04:08:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Oh, yeah, what's your date's name?
[ 2013-09-12 04:22:32 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | I'll tell you after I get some confidence in my relationship with her. I know its weird but its just something to guard my self esteem
[ 2013-09-12 04:22:41 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Stupid I know.
[ 2013-09-12 04:22:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | It's fine, man.
[ 2013-09-12 04:23:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | You can't depend on women soley for happiness or self-esteem, however.
[ 2013-09-12 04:24:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | This will be a test for me to see how well I can take my first real rejection.
[ 2013-09-12 04:24:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | There won't be any inferred answers or soft letdowns because I happen to be really great friends with the woman this time.
[ 2013-09-12 04:28:55 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward, as you might already know | Yep
[ 2013-09-12 04:33:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | All those beautiful secular women... I have to try at least three times, no matter how suspicous my mom gets about my checking account.
[ 2013-09-12 04:34:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | These aren't goggles of some sort either. I legitmately think most of the women in that particular meeting were quite a bit more attractive than the average I saw last year.
[ 2013-09-12 04:37:39 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I told Kyle a little about my situation last night, and earlier today as we were walking to dinner with another good acquaintance of mine (friend of his), he said out loud, &quot;Jalen, you should take this girl you like to get coffee, and ask her if she likes it black. Then say that once she goes black, she'll never go back.&quot; I wish that was verbatim. XD<e_m ts="1378960657" a="jalen.benjamin" t="61"/>
[ 2013-09-12 04:38:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | About five people that were within hearing distance in no particular direction heard him say that too.
[ 2013-09-12 04:38:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Alex and I cringed as we all chuckled awkwardly.
[ 2013-09-12 04:46:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | I'll catch you later, man. I have to go to bed soon.
[ 2013-09-12 04:46:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward, as you might already know | Good night, my brother.

[ 2013-09-13 13:41:54 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | under aged drinking is a tradition?
[ 2013-09-13 13:42:29 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it is a tradition for the american drink.  They don't care about the age i think.
[ 2013-09-13 13:42:37 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | . . .
[ 2013-09-13 13:42:45 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | illegal activities ftw

[ 2013-09-13 13:43:12 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm good
[ 2013-09-13 13:43:15 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | time to turn you guys in
[ 2013-09-13 13:43:26 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | im not drinking alcohol
[ 2013-09-13 13:43:33 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | josh is the one drinking alcohol
[ 2013-09-13 13:43:35 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i think you are
[ 2013-09-13 13:43:42 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and you and josh are the same person anyway
[ 2013-09-13 13:43:49 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so technically you did drink
[ 2013-09-13 13:44:00 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and you like beer
[ 2013-09-13 13:44:04 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so i can't turn josh in
[ 2013-09-13 13:44:09 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | because that would be turning myself in
[ 2013-09-13 13:44:21 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so i guess the only logical thing to do
[ 2013-09-13 13:44:23 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | is murder you
[ 2013-09-13 13:44:26 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so there are no witnesses

[ 2013-09-13 20:42:36 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | why they don't care about jt?
[ 2013-09-13 20:42:40 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | he's not that interesting.
[ 2013-09-13 20:42:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | How were they able to determine this? Lol.
[ 2013-09-13 20:43:19 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | they didn't.  they were too bored by him to do a test.
[ 2013-09-13 20:43:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | :/
[ 2013-09-13 20:44:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I feel like I'm capable of being a boring person too, at least. Lol.
[ 2013-09-13 20:45:14 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | thank you based jalen
[ 2013-09-13 20:46:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Why do you spontaneously say that?
[ 2013-09-13 20:46:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | By the way, I hope you don't call me that if I get in a relationship with a woman. That would be an insult to her.
[ 2013-09-13 20:47:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Lol.
[ 2013-09-13 20:47:21 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol.  or it would be a compliment <ss type="wink">;)</ss>
[ 2013-09-13 20:47:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | No, it wouldn't. How?...
[ 2013-09-13 20:48:18 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | she's with based god.  that's a great compliment.
[ 2013-09-13 20:49:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Even if Basedness could be applied to me, I am not *the* god.
[ 2013-09-13 20:49:13 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but you are based god
[ 2013-09-13 20:49:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Also, wouldn't the very title imply that I'd cheat on her?
[ 2013-09-13 20:49:34 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | she would be ok with it
[ 2013-09-13 20:49:38 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | because you're based jalen
[ 2013-09-13 20:49:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | No, Tyler. I don't want to lose my first girlfriend by cheating on her. <ss type="cry">:'(</ss>
[ 2013-09-13 20:50:42 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | she would be offering her friends to you, jalen.  it's not technically cheating.
[ 2013-09-13 20:51:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Why would I even want someone like that as a girlfriend, though? It has to be a union between just two people. Lol.
[ 2013-09-13 20:52:58 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | because you're so based.  it's your gift and your curse.
[ 2013-09-13 20:53:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ...Does this mean my attempts to court a pretty lady will be in vain?......
[ 2013-09-13 20:53:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | <ss type="cry">:'(</ss>
[ 2013-09-13 20:53:48 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | no.  just means it will always work <ss type="wink">;)</ss>
[ 2013-09-13 20:54:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I don't want it to work *that* way. <ss type="cry">:'(</ss>
[ 2013-09-13 20:54:09 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | too bad
[ 2013-09-13 20:55:16 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Not if she doesn't know these inside jokes that you are currently using.
[ 2013-09-13 20:56:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I will never let her know, Tyler.
[ 2013-09-13 20:56:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Never.
[ 2013-09-13 20:56:36 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | never let her know the truth?
[ 2013-09-13 20:56:38 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that's cool with me
[ 2013-09-13 20:56:41 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i won't tell her
[ 2013-09-13 20:57:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | No, these are just inside jokes. They are not &quot;the truth.&quot;
[ 2013-09-13 20:57:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Lol.
[ 2013-09-13 20:58:18 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | oh suurree. . . . yeah, these are . . . uhh . . . jokes
[ 2013-09-13 20:58:48 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Once I start dating women, the term &quot;Basedness&quot; will be as far from the truth as possible.
[ 2013-09-13 20:59:23 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but until then, it isn't <ss type="wink">;)</ss>
[ 2013-09-13 20:59:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Tyler, no woman has thrown herself at me expecting some sexual pleasure. You could argue that these fraternity guys are Based in comparison.
[ 2013-09-13 20:59:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Ah, I see how it is...
[ 2013-09-13 20:59:44 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | no one is based in comparison.
[ 2013-09-13 21:00:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Unfortunately for you, I will be going on a coffee date soon enough, sir.

[ 2013-09-15 23:16:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | You're already done, eh? I don't blame you. Those three hours of waiting for my interest's first text made me feel like I already needed to move on.

[ 2013-09-15 23:30:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | It's all worth it if it turns out she does listen to harder music.
[ 2013-09-15 23:31:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | She gives me this impression that she does. One of the first things she said to me was something like, &quot;I don't like to be around that many people&quot; in this sort of quasi-Gothic tone of voice.
[ 2013-09-15 23:33:56 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Who knows? She might hate me as well.

[ 2013-09-15 23:41:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | This is interesting, man. Something is wrong with my Elementary OS distro already.
[ 2013-09-15 23:41:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I can't install updates or software from the center at al because the distro thinks they are all untrusted packages.
[ 2013-09-15 23:43:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Even my stepuncle and stepfather, the two most tech oriented people in my family other than myself, would be turned off by this.

[ 2013-09-15 23:49:56 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | As far as I'm concerned, not so much. I follow the directions of Ubuntu's forums to check the options in the settings, and that doesn't work.
[ 2013-09-15 23:50:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | What's even more interesting is that it tricks me into thinking I can check the settings, and then it gets rid of the checkmarks within a second.
[ 2013-09-15 23:51:23 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Wow.. so all you want to do is update?
[ 2013-09-15 23:52:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | And install some applications, but I can neither.
[ 2013-09-15 23:52:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | That's broken.
[ 2013-09-15 23:52:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | The OS doesn't even allow me to install its own updates for some reason.
[ 2013-09-15 23:52:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I would think at least those are authenticated.
[ 2013-09-15 23:54:53 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | try sudo apt-get dist-upgrade for updating
[ 2013-09-15 23:55:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Alright.
[ 2013-09-16 00:00:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | It seems to be downloading and installing a lot of thngs, so I think it's working so far. Lol.

[ 2013-09-16 01:20:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I've got to give it to Microsoft for simplicity.
[ 2013-09-16 01:21:01 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Lol yeah. Expecially when you have to manually make your own configuations
[ 2013-09-16 01:21:08 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Which I have had to do for gentoo
[ 2013-09-16 01:21:25 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | and sometimes arch would fuck up their automatic grub config file generation
[ 2013-09-16 01:21:32 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | so I would have to manually change that
[ 2013-09-16 01:22:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Linux is just too much of a pain in general, even noob Linux.
[ 2013-09-16 01:22:41 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Yep. It really is an OS for people who like to get their hands dirtty
[ 2013-09-16 01:23:47 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Canonical won't make Ubuntu a contender because of it in my opinion.
[ 2013-09-16 01:24:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | They've still got years of catch up to make to even get near OS X.
[ 2013-09-16 01:25:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | It's like I said in one of my articles.
[ 2013-09-16 01:25:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Is it worth it to pay $100 to not use Linux for a typical person?
[ 2013-09-16 01:25:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | No.
[ 2013-09-16 01:25:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | However, with that being said, it still is worth some amount of money to not use it if you are someone like me.
[ 2013-09-16 01:26:02 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Can you show me the article?
[ 2013-09-16 01:26:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Well, it's something I wrote. It's beyond amatuerish.
[ 2013-09-16 01:26:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | My point is that that's Linux's vice as a whole.
[ 2013-09-16 01:27:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Windows has the market cornered because they can charge money to give people something really easy to use.
[ 2013-09-16 01:27:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | It shouldn't be $100+ easily, but even I'd pay for a discounted option of 7.
[ 2013-09-16 01:28:15 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Yep.
[ 2013-09-16 01:28:34 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Mac OS X popularity comes from the same reason
[ 2013-09-16 01:29:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Apple would make a killing allowing other manufacturers to use OS X.
[ 2013-09-16 01:29:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | That could even change the face of PC gaming.
[ 2013-09-16 01:31:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Google better have Android for PC by 2020.
[ 2013-09-16 01:31:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | That would just be beyond stupid if they didn't do that.
[ 2013-09-16 01:32:48 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | They probably will
[ 2013-09-16 01:33:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I just want an Android tablet, too.
[ 2013-09-16 01:33:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I could honestly care less about this iPad.
[ 2013-09-16 01:33:27 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Nexus 7!
[ 2013-09-16 01:33:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | It's annoying that Google's apps are behind on iOS.
[ 2013-09-16 01:34:08 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | That really irks me because I can't even access my payed subscription service on my iPad yet.
[ 2013-09-16 01:34:21 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Should have gotten me a Nexus. Smh.
[ 2013-09-16 01:45:12 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | brb.. eating dinner
[ 2013-09-16 01:47:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Alright.
[ 2013-09-16 02:33:14 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Back
[ 2013-09-16 02:49:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | So am I.
[ 2013-09-16 02:53:47 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I've discovered since you were gone that Android for PC already exists.
[ 2013-09-16 02:54:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I've already been experimenting with the options that are out there, and I'm loving it.
[ 2013-09-16 02:54:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | It's definitely emulation at its finest.
[ 2013-09-16 03:16:32 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Yeah.. that is what alot of developers use to test apps
[ 2013-09-16 03:16:44 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | in development
[ 2013-09-16 03:17:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Enthusiasts use it as well. Bluestacks, for example, was created to allow Android users to run apps on their computers.
[ 2013-09-16 03:19:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | As someone who wishes he had had an Android tablet rather than an iPad, I like this quite a bit.
[ 2013-09-16 03:26:54 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Awesome
[ 2013-09-16 03:27:02 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I have to experiment with it at some point
[ 2013-09-16 03:27:23 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | There are many options, and as far as I'm concerned, they are all at least good:
[ 2013-09-16 03:27:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Android-x86
[ 2013-09-16 03:27:47 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Genymotion, which is my favorite so far.
[ 2013-09-16 03:27:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Bluestacks.
[ 2013-09-16 03:28:59 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Hmm.. you can use virtualboxfor Genymotion
[ 2013-09-16 03:29:23 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Indeed, and it sets it all quite nicely for the end user.
[ 2013-09-16 03:30:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Android-x86 also requires VirtualBox, but it's more like installing Ubuntu or the like where you have to have the ISO on hand.
[ 2013-09-16 03:30:10 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Those are easy to find either way.
[ 2013-09-16 03:31:47 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | This is so overpowered with InputDirector and Chrome Remote Desktop.
[ 2013-09-16 03:32:53 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | There is also Windroy as well.
[ 2013-09-16 03:32:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I almost forgot about that.
[ 2013-09-16 03:33:11 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | alright im walking back from honors now
[ 2013-09-16 03:33:17 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'll probably be on skype in like 30 min
[ 2013-09-16 03:33:25 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | if im not then i might have gotten murdered to death
[ 2013-09-16 03:33:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Bluestacks seems to be the most popular and the most outdated, and what I mean by that is that it seems to run on Android 2.X (hopefully 2.3).
[ 2013-09-16 03:33:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I can tell that it is 2.X because of how dated the aesthetics look.
[ 2013-09-16 03:34:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I didn't know Josh was here at Honors.
[ 2013-09-16 03:34:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Wow, he's going to do not so greatly in his classes if he's coming over here for the internet.
[ 2013-09-16 03:35:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | It's 11:34 over here, and he's not going to get back to Riverside until after midnight.
[ 2013-09-16 03:35:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Why would you even do that?...
[ 2013-09-16 03:36:54 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | So...
[ 2013-09-16 03:37:04 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | He has been going over to Honors for internet?
[ 2013-09-16 03:37:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Yeah, because of eSports, but he only does that during the weekdays where he is required &quot;to practice,&quot; which even I think is not worth it.
[ 2013-09-16 03:37:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | However, he just left here now.
[ 2013-09-16 03:37:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | It's a Sunday night, and it's almost midnight.
[ 2013-09-16 03:38:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Is he insane!?
[ 2013-09-16 03:38:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Columbia can be a bad city at night.
[ 2013-09-16 03:38:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | There's a lot of crime near us.
[ 2013-09-16 03:38:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | He is so immature for doing this.
[ 2013-09-16 03:39:48 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Wow.. for practice
[ 2013-09-16 03:39:55 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | sounds like the esports team is a bad influence
[ 2013-09-16 03:40:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I don't think he was practicing tonight.
[ 2013-09-16 03:40:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Even so, he should have the common sense to know when to quit.
[ 2013-09-16 03:41:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | If his mom ever found out he did something like this, she probably would panic.
[ 2013-09-16 03:41:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | And for good reason.
[ 2013-09-16 03:44:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | If I knew he was here even 20 minutes earlier, I would have told him to leave ASAP.
[ 2013-09-16 03:49:10 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Genymotion is quite unstable compared to the other emulators from what I've experienced so far.
[ 2013-09-16 03:49:48 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | It's great, but I'm going to play with Windroy a little more to see how it fairs.
[ 2013-09-16 04:05:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Bluestacks seems to be the best, although I have yet to try Android x86.
[ 2013-09-16 04:06:13 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I want to use this during a few of my more boring classes, and I know that using the VirtualBox is going to kick up my fans.
[ 2013-09-16 04:06:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I'll set one up later anyway since a preview of 4.3 is listed on x86's site.
[ 2013-09-16 04:06:46 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Give me a rec soon
[ 2013-09-16 04:06:56 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I want to start dabbling with android
[ 2013-09-16 04:07:11 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I have been interested in its inner workings for a while
[ 2013-09-16 04:07:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Bluestacks.
[ 2013-09-16 04:07:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | While it appears to run only on 2.X, it's the most stable option.
[ 2013-09-16 04:08:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I haven't run into any apps that are unsupported, and I don't see why I would since Bluestacks has the backing of Lenovo and other big named corporations.
[ 2013-09-16 04:08:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | It won the best of show at CES 2012 I believe.
[ 2013-09-16 04:08:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | CNET also praised it around that time.
[ 2013-09-16 04:09:56 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Yeah, I'm right about it running on 2.X.
[ 2013-09-16 04:10:04 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | Google Search does not have Google Now.
[ 2013-09-16 04:29:53 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i made it back alive!
[ 2013-09-16 04:29:55 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | <ss type="laugh">:D</ss>
[ 2013-09-16 04:30:53 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Why were you over here for so long?
[ 2013-09-16 04:36:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | I'm running Android 4.3 right now.
[ 2013-09-16 04:37:33 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | watching the world cup
[ 2013-09-16 04:37:37 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | downstairs
[ 2013-09-16 04:37:41 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | with the usc esports club
[ 2013-09-16 04:37:51 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it went on for even longer than i stayed like
[ 2013-09-16 04:37:53 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it started at 3

[ 2013-09-16 04:39:53 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | what if i said i loved you?
[ 2013-09-16 04:40:04 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | anybody can say that
[ 2013-09-16 04:40:18 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but i really  mean it
[ 2013-09-16 04:40:25 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i don't want to just get into your pants
[ 2013-09-16 04:40:50 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well ok then it must be true
[ 2013-09-16 04:41:00 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | <ss type="wink">;)</ss>  awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[ 2013-09-16 04:43:54 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i think i just hate the taste of alcohol
[ 2013-09-16 04:44:11 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | hmm
[ 2013-09-16 04:44:15 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i've never tasted it
[ 2013-09-16 04:44:21 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well
[ 2013-09-16 04:44:24 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it tastes awful to me
[ 2013-09-16 04:44:42 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so i guess it also tastes awful to me
[ 2013-09-16 04:44:43 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | which is sad because i want to be irresponsible
[ 2013-09-16 04:44:44 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but i cant
[ 2013-09-16 04:44:46 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-09-16 04:44:50 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | because it tastes so nasty
[ 2013-09-16 04:44:54 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | why do you want to be irresponsible?
[ 2013-09-16 04:45:07 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | because it's more fun than being responsible
[ 2013-09-16 04:45:17 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | example
[ 2013-09-16 04:45:40 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | the responsible thing would be to not jump into a cold pool at 3 am after drinking half a cup of 14% alcoholic cider with a bunch of my friends
[ 2013-09-16 04:45:54 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but then i'd just be sitting inside talking to nobody
[ 2013-09-16 04:46:08 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and still breathing
[ 2013-09-16 04:46:08 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so instead i did the irresponsible thing
[ 2013-09-16 04:46:17 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | which was very cold and might end up with me getting sick
[ 2013-09-16 04:46:21 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | O___O
[ 2013-09-16 04:46:23 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but it was much more fun
[ 2013-09-16 04:46:25 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | when was this?
[ 2013-09-16 04:46:29 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | last night
[ 2013-09-16 04:46:36 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ahh
[ 2013-09-16 04:46:41 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it was fun?
[ 2013-09-16 04:46:45 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | meh
[ 2013-09-16 04:46:46 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it was ok
[ 2013-09-16 04:46:49 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | O_____________O
[ 2013-09-16 04:46:52 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it was more fun than doing nothing
[ 2013-09-16 04:47:13 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | sounds like something i'd rather not do.
[ 2013-09-16 04:47:21 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm not a fan of jumping into pools, though
[ 2013-09-16 04:47:24 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i don't like them
[ 2013-09-16 04:47:24 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-09-16 04:47:25 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well
[ 2013-09-16 04:47:29 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i didnt jump in exactly

[ 2013-09-16 04:53:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | When I went to turn it off and start back again, it took me back to the installation process. That probably means I have to use save states each time I stop using it.
[ 2013-09-16 04:53:16 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so it's hard for me to find shit to talk about
[ 2013-09-16 04:53:31 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and a lot of times people make references i dont get but everybody else gets
[ 2013-09-16 04:53:46 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Jalen Benjamin | Hi | It's pretty nice, but there is lag, and I read that after about 1 to 2 GB of RAM, there's no use in giving the VirtualBox more.
[ 2013-09-16 04:53:48 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and i cant make references to stuff i like cuz fewer people like it

[ 2013-09-16 04:57:38 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i usually like
[ 2013-09-16 04:57:43 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | start hearing more and more about them
[ 2013-09-16 04:57:46 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and get to understand them more
[ 2013-09-16 04:57:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Josh, there is the Secular Student Alliance, although, you probably wouldn't like that organization.
[ 2013-09-16 04:57:51 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and that's when i REALLY hate them

[ 2013-09-16 04:58:26 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | when i start understanding people more
[ 2013-09-16 04:58:26 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | if i talked to everybody
[ 2013-09-16 04:58:30 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i fucking loathe them
[ 2013-09-16 04:58:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's an organization of the higher thinking, Agnostics, Atheists, etc. With those kinds of people, they tend to be nerdier.
[ 2013-09-16 04:58:31 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'd never talk to people again

[ 2013-09-16 04:59:05 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah but those kind of people usually end up being pseudo-intellectual cunts who think they're &quot;enlightened&quot;
[ 2013-09-16 04:59:32 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | The problem with SSA for you is that you would get into a lot of heated arguments with people.
[ 2013-09-16 04:59:49 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | So, while they are nerdy, some of them are staunch Atheists.

[ 2013-09-16 22:58:56 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | pretty good.  Working on my speech about quantum teleportation

[ 2013-09-17 03:09:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Reviewers are excited about GTA V, Josh.
[ 2013-09-17 03:09:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm going to try to buy it months down the road.
[ 2013-09-17 03:10:06 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | =o
[ 2013-09-17 03:10:11 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | everybody is excited about it lol
[ 2013-09-17 03:10:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Adam Sessler of Rev3Games really makes me want to play it.
[ 2013-09-17 03:11:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | By the way, if you want to check out video game commentary, news, and reviews, Rev3Games is so much more detailed than IGN and Gamespot a lot of the time.
[ 2013-09-17 03:12:24 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ah
[ 2013-09-17 03:12:28 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | alrighty
[ 2013-09-17 03:12:39 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | do they do video reviews?
[ 2013-09-17 03:13:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Sessler has been in the business for quite a while, man. He joined Rev3Games more than eight months ago. I didn't understand his significance much then, and I admit I still don't know all of his history, but it's a big deal that he's there: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pciGmXmE3uk&amp;feature=youtube_video_deck">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pciGmXmE3uk&amp;feature=youtube_video_deck</a>
[ 2013-09-17 03:13:53 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That's his review of GTA V.
[ 2013-09-17 03:14:20 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I want to show my Jour 201 teacher this because Sessler's vocabulary is quite advanced for a journalist.
[ 2013-09-17 03:14:36 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | hm
[ 2013-09-17 03:14:50 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm not so sure it's a good thing to use an advanced vocabulary as a journalist
[ 2013-09-17 03:14:59 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | since that would make you less understandable to the popular masses
[ 2013-09-17 03:15:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah, it's a bad thing to do. Journalists are suppose to write and read at an 8th grade level, but his vocabulary sometimes drifts into college territory.
[ 2013-09-17 03:16:21 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | People in the comments praise him for it, but at the same time, that's not an indicator of good journalism necessarily.
[ 2013-09-17 03:16:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | His review is great, but its one vice is the vocabulary.
[ 2013-09-17 03:16:41 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that's so sad that we have to dumb ourselves down to 8th grade reading level in order to communicate with the average person
[ 2013-09-17 03:17:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | 14% of men and 25% of women hold college degrees, unfortunately.
[ 2013-09-17 03:17:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | In the United States.
[ 2013-09-17 03:17:52 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but 8th grade man
[ 2013-09-17 03:17:56 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that's not even high school
[ 2013-09-17 03:18:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's pathetic in my opinion, but even The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the like write at that level.
[ 2013-09-17 03:19:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | If Sessler was the news director for both those papers, they would easily be at a 11th grade level.
[ 2013-09-17 03:19:23 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | which is where we should be at
[ 2013-09-17 03:20:12 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Definitely. I thought that college degree holders would have a much higher percentage in the United States, but I suppose not.
[ 2013-09-17 03:20:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | So, journalists, the watch dogs of society, have to dumb themselves down as a result.
[ 2013-09-17 03:21:36 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i think it's less about the amount of people with college degrees and more about the lack of focus on public education at the stage before college
[ 2013-09-17 03:21:56 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i've heard many people talk about how college is a scam, how it's not really for everyone, etc
[ 2013-09-17 03:22:11 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i think the focus should be less on college and more on high school, where it's still mandatory to attend
[ 2013-09-17 03:22:47 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Indeed. Personal financial classes should at least be required at the high school level.
[ 2013-09-17 03:24:36 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | fucking this^^^^^^^
[ 2013-09-17 03:24:43 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i never learned anything about paying bills and shit
[ 2013-09-17 03:24:57 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | classes about how to sustain yourself should be mandatory
[ 2013-09-17 03:25:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | That's how you do a general education course, United States.
[ 2013-09-17 03:25:46 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I took one in 10th grade of high school, and I remember nothing at the moment.
[ 2013-09-17 03:28:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | By the way, Rev3Games did a review of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs as well.
[ 2013-09-17 03:29:31 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ah
[ 2013-09-17 03:29:38 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i saw somebody on 4chan who said they played that
[ 2013-09-17 03:30:23 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's quite good. It's just not as good as The Dark Descent.
[ 2013-09-17 03:30:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | There's also a game by the name of Outlast that might be even scarier than A Machine for Pigs.
[ 2013-09-17 03:32:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Did you see that link I sent you in our one on one chat by the way?
[ 2013-09-17 03:34:59 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | no
[ 2013-09-17 03:35:00 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that's weird
[ 2013-09-17 03:35:03 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i dont see any lik
[ 2013-09-17 03:35:04 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | link
[ 2013-09-17 03:35:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Wow. My messages to you disappeared.
[ 2013-09-17 03:36:12 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | huh
[ 2013-09-17 03:36:17 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | probably somethign to do with my shitty internet
[ 2013-09-17 03:36:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Lol. It's all good, man.
[ 2013-09-17 03:38:46 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | im tired of it lol
[ 2013-09-17 03:38:49 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it's probably good for me though
[ 2013-09-17 03:38:55 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | cuz it's hard for me to play league all night
[ 2013-09-17 03:39:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Party 'till the break of dawn.
[ 2013-09-17 03:39:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Josh, let's go to a party of some organization and have a good time.
[ 2013-09-17 03:40:29 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | alrighty i'm down
[ 2013-09-17 03:40:34 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | what kinda party do you wanna go to
[ 2013-09-17 03:41:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Something like SSA or Quidditch where there are more likely to be people like us.
[ 2013-09-17 03:41:33 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | you should come play quidditch jalen =o
[ 2013-09-17 03:41:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I would suck. Lol.
[ 2013-09-17 03:42:00 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-09-17 03:42:09 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | our team is actually a lot better this year than last year
[ 2013-09-17 03:42:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Sweet!
[ 2013-09-17 03:43:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Apparently, in our game against Vanderbilt, the majority of students left.
[ 2013-09-17 03:43:35 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah but it's gonna be a lot harder for me to get on the main team this year lol
[ 2013-09-17 03:43:43 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | whys that
[ 2013-09-17 03:43:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's led to an outcry for the team as well as the student press.
[ 2013-09-17 03:44:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | We're spoiled with winning basically.
[ 2013-09-17 03:44:16 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | We were up big at the half, and then everyone decided to leave.
[ 2013-09-17 03:44:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Vanderbilt almost won that game.
[ 2013-09-17 03:45:05 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ah
[ 2013-09-17 03:45:08 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well we are like number 8
[ 2013-09-17 03:45:23 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i think it's understandable to want to leave early
[ 2013-09-17 03:45:28 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | especially if it's that big of a lead
[ 2013-09-17 03:45:39 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | cuz i mean stadium traffic was absolute shit
[ 2013-09-17 03:45:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | No, I disagree because we don't even pay money to go to those games.
[ 2013-09-17 03:45:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Seriously, that's demoralizing to our team and our coaches.
[ 2013-09-17 03:46:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Connor Shaw was very disappointed.
[ 2013-09-17 03:46:02 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | hm
[ 2013-09-17 03:46:08 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so we should be forced to stay the whole time?
[ 2013-09-17 03:46:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | No, but you should want to. We don't have to pay anything for it, and yet, all the other sections do.
[ 2013-09-17 03:46:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | We could lose games because our team gets distracted by everyone leaving.
[ 2013-09-17 03:47:08 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i suppose it is considered rude
[ 2013-09-17 03:47:21 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Imagine the morale turning as the opposing team realizes they don't even have to yell to hear their quarterback making plays.
[ 2013-09-17 03:47:41 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i can see what you're saying
[ 2013-09-17 03:47:56 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | thankfully it doesn't apply to me personally because i don't find football interesting enough to want to go
[ 2013-09-17 03:48:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah, I don't feel like going to games alone anymore.
[ 2013-09-17 03:49:05 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i would never go to a game alone lol
[ 2013-09-17 03:49:10 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i would hate it
[ 2013-09-17 03:49:39 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I did after a while. It got to me to see all those people hanging out, and that I couldn't find anyone on my hall willing to go to games with me.
[ 2013-09-17 03:49:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm done with that.
[ 2013-09-17 03:50:43 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah most honors kids are probably busy studying <ss type="tongueout">:P</ss>
[ 2013-09-17 03:51:16 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | You'd be dead wrong about that.
[ 2013-09-17 03:51:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Seriously.
[ 2013-09-17 03:52:17 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | really?
[ 2013-09-17 03:52:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | The upper floors are party central, and I've seen marijuana because of Honors students and no one else.
[ 2013-09-17 03:52:22 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-09-17 03:52:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I've been offered alcohol and marijuana many times.
[ 2013-09-17 03:55:17 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | damn
[ 2013-09-17 03:55:21 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i've never been offered weed
[ 2013-09-17 03:58:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'm just not into it personally. Lol.
[ 2013-09-17 03:59:39 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | idk if i'm into it cuz i've never tried it
[ 2013-09-17 04:00:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | As an asthmatic, I don't want to take that risk.
[ 2013-09-17 04:01:10 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | oh yeah that's true.
[ 2013-09-17 04:03:09 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'll brb gonna take a shower
[ 2013-09-17 04:04:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Okay.
[ 2013-09-17 04:22:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Good evening, Edward.
[ 2013-09-17 04:26:48 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Hi
[ 2013-09-17 04:26:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | How has your day been?
[ 2013-09-17 04:27:09 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ITs been great so far
[ 2013-09-17 04:27:14 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I can get a chromebook!!
[ 2013-09-17 04:29:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Someone just knocked on my door because some idiot replaced my sign earlier with the one of the same guy just like from a few nights ago. XD
[ 2013-09-17 04:29:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Her reaction was priceless.
[ 2013-09-17 04:29:48 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | And that's great that you can get a Chromebook.
[ 2013-09-17 04:30:41 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ya

[ 2013-09-17 04:36:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | He's practically speechless about it.
[ 2013-09-17 04:36:53 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-09-17 04:36:57 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | YEAH
[ 2013-09-17 04:37:04 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | GTA 5 muthafuckas
[ 2013-09-17 04:37:39 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-09-17 04:37:45 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | only 1 more year till pc release <ss type="cry">;(</ss>
[ 2013-09-17 04:38:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's not on PC yet?
[ 2013-09-17 04:38:38 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | no
[ 2013-09-17 04:38:41 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | not true
[ 2013-09-17 04:38:45 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | no
[ 2013-09-17 04:38:48 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I refuse
[ 2013-09-17 04:39:13 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Did you know there is an actual petition to stop the PC port all together
[ 2013-09-17 04:39:20 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol wtf
[ 2013-09-17 04:39:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Yeah. It's trolling, though.
[ 2013-09-17 04:39:32 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | console faggots
[ 2013-09-17 04:39:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | The person, probably some 14 year old, wanted to point the finger at PC gamers for pirating the game.
[ 2013-09-17 04:40:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Later that day, I saw a screen capture of torrents of GTA IV for the 360 and PS3.
[ 2013-09-17 04:40:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | As a response to the petition.

&quot;We [Carnegie Mellon] limit our enrollment to 130 new freshmen, so we never had an enrollment dip here at CMU,&quot; Lee says. &quot;The quality of the applications is up. We're seeing some pretty amazing kids. Of the 2,600 applications we received, 600 to 800 of them deserve to be here.&quot; 
Of the 130 enrolled, it’s likely less than half will actually graduate with a degree in Computer Science

[ 2013-09-18 01:37:42 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | the first one is &lt;t^3,t^2&gt;
[ 2013-09-18 01:37:50 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so that's 2d
[ 2013-09-18 01:38:02 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | hm

[ 2013-09-18 01:40:31 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | you're given an equation z/c = x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2
[ 2013-09-18 01:40:43 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | what does the graph of this produce
[ 2013-09-18 01:40:43 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and the answer is

[ 2013-09-19 23:10:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Statistics 201 has some uneccessary parts to it (i.e., the fact that there are labs).
[ 2013-09-19 23:10:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | It's my least favorite class this semester.
[ 2013-09-19 23:11:29 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | the sad part is that this is my favorite class
[ 2013-09-19 23:12:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Everyone in my class hated last weeks lab. There was so much complaining, but for a decent reason: a lot of us had to stay overtime to finish it.
[ 2013-09-19 23:13:14 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Since my professor and the other professor overseeing the two lab sections of my particular class are first generation Chinese or Tawainese, everyone kept complaining because they knew that they wouldn't be able to understand them all at the same time.

[ 2013-09-20 04:08:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | She reminds me a lot of Mark Tremonti with her soloing. At least on this song, the more catch riffs sound punk, so that's where they differ.
[ 2013-09-20 04:09:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I do think of Tremonti when I hear her soloing.
[ 2013-09-20 04:09:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Now, that would be an awesome mashup.
[ 2013-09-20 04:09:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I also heard a bit of Tom Morello in the last song.
[ 2013-09-20 04:09:44 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Who, by the way, is a big fan of the SuicideGirls. That's what I'm talking about.
[ 2013-09-20 04:10:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Ah, I remember how I heard of her. She was the lead guitarist for Michael Jackson at the time he died. I somehow stumbled across her name while watching her perform in a clip, looked her up, and then forgot about her.
[ 2013-09-20 04:11:09 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Yep she was supposed to play in his latest tour
[ 2013-09-20 04:11:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | This makes me excited for Alter Bridge's new album. I can't wait.
[ 2013-09-20 04:12:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I haven't listened to the Tremonti Project in a while either. It's about time to change that.

[ 2013-09-20 04:18:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Wow, Tremonti is moving his hands pretty fast back and forth on that breakdown.

[ 2013-09-20 05:20:21 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I'm disappointed in one of the loads, however.
[ 2013-09-20 05:20:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | The clothes aren't completely dry.
[ 2013-09-20 05:20:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I'm not doing a third load just for that, though.
[ 2013-09-20 05:20:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Those machines could be better. I already have to do two loads every week anyway.
[ 2013-09-20 05:23:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Forget this iPad. I want a Chromebook.

[ 2013-09-20 05:25:20 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I'd use it more if Apple or a third party company made a 30 pin to ethernet adapter.
[ 2013-09-20 05:25:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I can't find one on Amazon, which means this thing is useless for internet connectivity.

[ 2013-09-22 20:59:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I found an interesting YouTuber by the way.
[ 2013-09-22 21:00:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | She comes off as GirlGoneGamer in a way that her blogging skills (and sex appeal) are quite alluring, but she has the added benefit (in my eyes) of being an Atheist.
[ 2013-09-22 21:01:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I've subscribed to her, although, I had to watch at least 30 minutes of video before I did.
[ 2013-09-22 21:01:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Not necessarily her fault.
[ 2013-09-22 21:01:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Raya has just made me aware of pretty faces.
[ 2013-09-22 21:01:24 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so you can read from a txt file
[ 2013-09-22 21:01:28 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yea
[ 2013-09-22 21:01:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | If she's not an Atheist, then this girl is at least impeccable of playing the part.
[ 2013-09-22 21:02:05 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | So you need a file object like File file = new File(&quot;filename&quot;);
[ 2013-09-22 21:02:08 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I honestly hope that she isn't fake because man, I would love to talk to a girl like this.
[ 2013-09-22 21:02:14 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and then initialize the scanner
[ 2013-09-22 21:02:23 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | by Scanner scan = new Scanner(file);
[ 2013-09-22 21:03:34 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Oh man GGG
[ 2013-09-22 21:03:45 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | she is still blogging a good bit
[ 2013-09-22 21:03:48 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | the hate is immense lol
[ 2013-09-22 21:04:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Definitely. I surprised that she hasn't made a video addressing it yet.
[ 2013-09-22 21:04:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I wish there was something YouTube could do about it.
[ 2013-09-22 21:04:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | What she's doing (if it is true) is immoral.
[ 2013-09-22 21:04:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Apparently, even her giveaways were faked.
[ 2013-09-22 21:04:52 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ok
[ 2013-09-22 21:05:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I don't even find her attractive anymore to be honest. She can't compare to this new YouTuber I've stumbled across.
[ 2013-09-22 21:05:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | In addition, if this all is true, Raya would have to be my first overall 0 to 1 for a girl.
[ 2013-09-22 21:06:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I'm watching as many videos by YouTubers who deserve a lot more subscribers than she does to get more details.
[ 2013-09-22 21:06:55 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | now how do i convert the string stuff into a double array?
[ 2013-09-22 21:06:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | She blocks people for the littlest thing (if what they're saying is true).
[ 2013-09-22 21:07:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | It's still just assumption, but Raya is making herself guilty by not saying anything at all.
[ 2013-09-22 21:07:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | That's why I believe she is guilty at the moment.
[ 2013-09-22 21:07:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Just say something.
[ 2013-09-22 21:08:48 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Umm... so what do you exactly have to do?
[ 2013-09-22 21:09:21 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Whether she likes it or not, Raya is essentially a broadcast journalist (amateur, of course), and she's not being loyal to her audience.
[ 2013-09-22 21:09:21 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Write a program that finds the greatest product of four consecutive numbers in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonal) in the 20×20 matrix or grid of numbers.   I have to get these numbers from a txt file
[ 2013-09-22 21:09:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | That is the number one thing in journalism. I promise you.
[ 2013-09-22 21:09:45 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Commentary is journalism, and she's being dishonest and unethical.
[ 2013-09-22 21:10:30 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | So I Don;t really remember how scanner gets int
[ 2013-09-22 21:10:37 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but it would be like this
[ 2013-09-22 21:11:13 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Let's say your double array name is like doubarr
[ 2013-09-22 21:11:36 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | To put all the int's into the double array from the text file, I think it is like
[ 2013-09-22 21:12:46 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | for( int i = 0, i &lt; doubarr.length, i ++){
    for(int j = 0, j &lt; doubarr[i].length, j++){
        doubarr[i][j] = scan.nextInt();
   }
[ 2013-09-22 21:12:52 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | }
[ 2013-09-22 21:16:34 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Lol
[ 2013-09-22 21:16:37 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it says inputmismatchexception
[ 2013-09-22 21:16:44 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | She faked her givaways?
[ 2013-09-22 21:16:49 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | How did she do that?
[ 2013-09-22 21:17:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Her brother or someone who she's close to &quot;ghost plays&quot; them for her.
[ 2013-09-22 21:17:29 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | She later commentates over them.
[ 2013-09-22 21:17:45 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Is your textfile all integers?
[ 2013-09-22 21:17:49 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yea

[ 2013-09-22 21:18:11 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and spaces
[ 2013-09-22 21:18:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | She makes a video saying that she is going to do said giveaway with the prizes in front of her, and she simply never gives them out.

[ 2013-09-22 21:18:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | There are a lack of responses on YouTube that show anyone thanking Raya for his or her prize.
[ 2013-09-22 21:19:16 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Did somebody call? Anyway, JT can you send me the .java file

[ 2013-09-23 03:05:50 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | you don't understand how this works
[ 2013-09-23 03:05:59 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | you need to have a reason to do something, not a reason NOT to do something
[ 2013-09-23 03:06:10 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i don't need a reason for anything
[ 2013-09-23 03:06:32 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | if you lived your life by the &quot;why would i not do this&quot; ideology then you would be constantly torn by the endless possibilities of what to do in the world
[ 2013-09-23 03:06:57 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | for example
[ 2013-09-23 03:07:00 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | you could work out with me

[ 2013-09-23 03:08:50 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm actually 100% positive
[ 2013-09-23 03:09:02 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | there's no reason for me to use any other time zone besides the one we live in
[ 2013-09-23 03:09:23 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol

[ 2013-09-23 03:14:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Unless, this is a library that I'm not aware of.

[ 2013-09-23 04:07:57 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ^.^
[ 2013-09-23 04:08:07 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but yeah i gotta do the ugly leader thing this weekend

[ 2013-09-23 04:08:15 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and only 5 spots
[ 2013-09-23 04:10:11 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Ah i see
[ 2013-09-23 04:11:13 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I don't like where things are going for Josh.
[ 2013-09-23 04:12:56 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Me neither
[ 2013-09-23 04:13:04 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Well, no vector cal b/c of league
[ 2013-09-23 04:13:30 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | indeed
[ 2013-09-23 04:13:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | It's just a game. Why would playing that all weekend ever be more important than Vector?
[ 2013-09-23 04:15:21 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | It isn't
[ 2013-09-23 04:15:35 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Lol... Game Addiction is a bitch man
[ 2013-09-23 04:15:50 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Well, good luck with that leader stuff
[ 2013-09-23 04:16:12 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | thx bruh
[ 2013-09-23 04:16:14 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | He and JT are in one of the hardest majors at USC.
[ 2013-09-23 04:16:21 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | They can't afford to have game addictions.
[ 2013-09-23 04:16:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Josh is at risk of becoming a fifth year senior already.
[ 2013-09-23 04:17:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | His scholarships and financial aid could go out the window if he does have to return for a fifth year.
[ 2013-09-23 04:17:27 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Is Jt still comp sci?
[ 2013-09-23 04:17:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Yeah.
[ 2013-09-23 04:17:39 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | I see
[ 2013-09-23 04:17:46 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Ok. Well them
[ 2013-09-23 04:17:47 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | then
[ 2013-09-23 04:19:01 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | That is problem
[ 2013-09-23 04:19:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | At this specific moment, JT is fucked psychologically and academically unless the former improves.
[ 2013-09-23 04:19:43 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Yep. The problem here is competition. They will be competing with people over seas and America for jobs in comp sci or whatnot
[ 2013-09-23 04:19:51 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | so.... not good
[ 2013-09-23 04:20:19 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | I'M BACK
[ 2013-09-23 04:20:21 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | MWAHAHAHAHA
[ 2013-09-23 04:20:22 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | FWAHAHAHAHAHAH
[ 2013-09-23 04:20:54 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | God, JT is so clueless that it's borderline infuriating at moments.
[ 2013-09-23 04:23:21 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Yeah. Well, they will learn at some point
[ 2013-09-23 04:23:25 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | one or another
[ 2013-09-23 04:23:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Josh should have learned from summer school.
[ 2013-09-23 04:26:08 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Sigh. This makes me wonder about the critics of video game addiction
[ 2013-09-23 04:26:28 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | It affects the work ethic of most of its victims
[ 2013-09-23 04:26:47 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | fine don't talk
[ 2013-09-23 04:26:49 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | plebs
[ 2013-09-23 04:28:30 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | JT, I'm going to take a page from Tyler's book and say you should stop talking.
[ 2013-09-23 04:28:40 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[ 2013-09-23 04:29:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | We get it already. You don't have to evil laugh or the like every single time you return.
[ 2013-09-23 04:30:08 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Maybe the anime is getting to JT
[ 2013-09-23 04:30:10 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i can't go on without my laugh D:
[ 2013-09-23 04:30:10 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | who knows
[ 2013-09-23 04:30:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | How so do you think?
[ 2013-09-23 04:31:46 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I do think because of his love for anime and what not that he has no chance in hell with Lydia.
[ 2013-09-23 04:32:03 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it is like my thing
[ 2013-09-23 04:32:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Couple that with his inability to speak and intense social awkwardness, and you have a recipe for potential disaster.
[ 2013-09-23 04:33:27 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | there are new things jt
[ 2013-09-23 04:33:31 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | better things
[ 2013-09-23 04:34:16 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | like laughing like an evil genius!!
[ 2013-09-23 04:34:17 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Well.. Its a shaky theory, but it has to do with the uncanny valleyt
[ 2013-09-23 04:34:24 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | and the loss of reality in general
[ 2013-09-23 04:35:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Ah, I see what you're saying.
[ 2013-09-23 04:35:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I just hope I don't become like him.
[ 2013-09-23 04:35:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I can see Tyler becomes intensly annoyed with JT at times.
[ 2013-09-23 04:36:23 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I have for a while, but I hoped he'd have matured enough by this point to make it worthwhile.
[ 2013-09-23 04:37:14 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Me too. I have thought about the anime-real world theory for a while
[ 2013-09-23 04:37:29 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Most would call me crazy which is why I tend to keep to myself
[ 2013-09-23 04:39:43 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | JT better not get Lydia involved with that.
[ 2013-09-23 04:41:22 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | He might
[ 2013-09-23 04:41:28 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Actually its likely
[ 2013-09-23 04:42:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | He's an ignorant fool if he even tries.
[ 2013-09-23 04:43:56 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | I agree.
[ 2013-09-23 04:44:27 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Damn... wtf happened since the beginning of summer
[ 2013-09-23 04:44:33 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | well the end of summer
[ 2013-09-23 04:44:41 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Everything went to shit
[ 2013-09-23 04:45:11 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | What do you mean by everything? I don't feel much is out of place, but I want to hear your take.
[ 2013-09-23 04:47:36 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Well. I always thought the summer time was quite quaint
[ 2013-09-23 04:47:55 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | It was simple.. played video games and talked on skype. Nothing too major happened
[ 2013-09-23 04:48:15 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | But ever since school started,....
[ 2013-09-23 04:48:17 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | And that's the problem with JT and Josh. They're too used to that.
[ 2013-09-23 04:49:58 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Yeah. I noticed alot of bad events occur as soon as school starts.
[ 2013-09-23 04:51:06 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | FUCK THIS HOMEWORK
[ 2013-09-23 04:51:08 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | fuckin

[ 2013-09-23 04:51:19 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | part a has 6 parts
[ 2013-09-23 04:51:27 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | fuck this &quot;it's only 10 questions&quot; bullshit
[ 2013-09-23 04:51:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | A lot of frustration, certainly.
[ 2013-09-23 04:52:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Perfect timing.
[ 2013-09-23 04:52:10 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Josh is starting to lose it.
[ 2013-09-23 04:54:57 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Lol
[ 2013-09-23 04:55:30 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | What problem is this?
[ 2013-09-23 04:56:09 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | gives me a vector function, &lt;2sint,11t,2cost&gt; and i have to find the unit tangent and unit normal vectors T( t ) and N( t )
[ 2013-09-23 04:56:13 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | wow fuck you skype
[ 2013-09-23 04:58:12 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and then part b is find the curvature
[ 2013-09-23 04:59:46 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | So did you find unit tangent?
[ 2013-09-23 05:01:17 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah i found them both now, im on the curvature part
[ 2013-09-23 05:02:17 ] Sender: Edward Kim | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | Oh.. ok.

[ 2013-09-23 05:07:16 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I hope I can find people (in other words, women) that appreciate a man who can get his work done on time most of the time instead of wasting away on LoL and the like.

[ 2013-09-23 05:12:07 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | I would flip my shit
[ 2013-09-23 05:12:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Oh, indeed. I'd question the girl's tastes as well.
[ 2013-09-23 05:14:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Even so, I'd be tempted (and maybe even try) to steal her away.

[ 2013-09-23 05:16:20 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Yep
[ 2013-09-23 05:16:43 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Would kill me inside
[ 2013-09-23 05:18:15 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | If it was another &quot;Marina&quot; in the case of JT, I would try to steal her away from someone like him.
[ 2013-09-23 05:23:49 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Well.. lets just hope that it doesn't devolve into a situation like that
[ 2013-09-23 05:24:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I feel like JT can't attract women like Marina in his current state, so it's fine.
[ 2013-09-23 05:24:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | The women he'd attract I wouldn't consider the majority of the time.
[ 2013-09-23 05:29:29 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Are women even attracted to us?
[ 2013-09-23 05:29:33 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | or at least to me anyway
[ 2013-09-23 05:29:39 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | I don't so
[ 2013-09-23 05:31:08 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I'd argue that they are. Even at this point in our lives, we've met less than .0001% of the world's population.
[ 2013-09-23 05:31:48 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | There is certainly someone out there for the both of us, but who knows? They might not be at our respective universities at all.
[ 2013-09-23 05:32:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | The percentages aren't completely zero in either direction.
[ 2013-09-23 05:35:01 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | True. Listen I have to get some things from Walgreens for the night. I know its late for you so if I don't talk to you again, good night my brother

[ 2013-09-24 20:39:35 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | also jt being a bitch
[ 2013-09-24 20:39:42 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so everything's normal?
[ 2013-09-24 20:39:46 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i asked him why he put that for the question
[ 2013-09-24 20:39:47 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | pretty much
[ 2013-09-24 20:39:48 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and he was like
[ 2013-09-24 20:39:50 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | &quot;i have my reasons&quot;
[ 2013-09-24 20:39:58 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | instead of saying he copied off chegg
[ 2013-09-24 20:40:08 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so basically
[ 2013-09-24 20:40:09 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | jt cheated
[ 2013-09-24 20:40:15 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and then
[ 2013-09-24 20:40:17 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | basically a lot of people cheated
[ 2013-09-24 20:40:18 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | he didn't admit to it
[ 2013-09-24 20:40:17 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-09-24 20:40:23 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so that you could do worse on your homework
[ 2013-09-24 20:40:33 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah he did pretty much
[ 2013-09-24 20:40:34 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and now he's trying to justify it like the little b**** he is
[ 2013-09-24 20:40:38 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-09-24 20:40:48 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it's ok
[ 2013-09-24 20:40:56 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | when he gets to the test it'll be funny
[ 2013-09-24 20:41:14 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | especially when he gets the pregnancy test
[ 2013-09-24 20:41:15 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well i have some good news and some good news from my side of the fence
[ 2013-09-24 20:41:41 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that 37 I got on my material science test turns out to be a 76.7
[ 2013-09-24 20:41:46 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so that's a bit of a relief
[ 2013-09-24 20:41:51 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | good job
[ 2013-09-24 20:41:52 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and I got a 94 on my organic test

[ 2013-09-24 20:42:03 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | congrats
[ 2013-09-24 20:42:41 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | my good news for the day is that i only have to consume around 40 or 50 more grams of protein to meet my daily requirement
[ 2013-09-24 20:43:21 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol.  one triple baconator should do it
[ 2013-09-24 20:43:30 ] Sender: JT | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that's fat tyler
[ 2013-09-24 20:43:38 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and protein so shut the fuck up jt
[ 2013-09-24 20:43:59 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | fat doesnt make you fat
[ 2013-09-24 20:44:01 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | not working out makes you fat
[ 2013-09-24 20:44:49 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah.  and jt, you do realize that meat is an amazing source of protein, so the fact that the triple baconator has 3 beaf patties and a hundred strips of bacon means that it has protein, right?
[ 2013-09-24 20:45:09 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i made my own double cheeseburger today tyler

[ 2013-09-24 20:45:53 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so anyways, a triple baconator has 90 grams of protein
[ 2013-09-24 20:45:54 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | nobody will believe jt anyway
[ 2013-09-24 20:45:57 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | he lies all the time

[ 2013-09-24 20:46:17 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | here's the nutritional facts about triple baconators:

[ 2013-09-24 20:46:18 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | shut the fuck up jt nobody asked you about your lies
[ 2013-09-24 20:46:26 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | josh, how much protein do you eat per day?
[ 2013-09-24 20:46:33 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well
[ 2013-09-24 20:46:47 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i'm supposed to eat about 1g per lb of body weight
[ 2013-09-24 20:46:54 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | according to sources
[ 2013-09-24 20:47:06 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so about 125 or so
[ 2013-09-24 20:47:18 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ahh, so a triple baconator gives you like 65-75% of your amount
[ 2013-09-24 20:47:22 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | yeah
[ 2013-09-24 20:47:33 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and 86 grams of fat
[ 2013-09-24 20:47:49 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i've already had protein powder (30g) and a double cheeseburger(~45g)
[ 2013-09-24 20:48:11 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | too bad triple baconator costs a lot of money
[ 2013-09-24 20:48:13 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ;-;
[ 2013-09-24 20:48:22 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | 1330 calories is beautiful though
[ 2013-09-24 20:48:27 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i need about 3000
[ 2013-09-24 20:48:30 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | to gain weight
[ 2013-09-24 20:48:33 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | per day
[ 2013-09-24 20:48:42 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | lol
[ 2013-09-24 20:48:58 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so eat two of them and you'll be set for over your day's worth of protein
[ 2013-09-24 20:49:04 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and almost your days worth of calories
[ 2013-09-24 20:49:19 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | all righty
[ 2013-09-24 20:49:23 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well i'm heading off to meet joy
[ 2013-09-24 20:49:25 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | cya guys later
[ 2013-09-24 20:49:25 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | alrighty
[ 2013-09-24 20:49:27 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | cya
[ 2013-09-24 20:49:48 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so i found out that he didnt find the second page
[ 2013-09-24 20:49:54 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | so that's like .8 of the points i'm missing
[ 2013-09-24 20:50:03 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i need to find out where the fuck that 2nd page is
[ 2013-09-24 20:50:25 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | that would bring my grade up to a 3.3 if i got both of the problems
[ 2013-09-23 18:32:40 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | U | Edward, I really dislike United States history.
[ 2013-09-23 18:32:53 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | U | It's so disgusting, and I'm kinda sick of this class.
[ 2013-09-23 18:33:06 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | U | I'm tired of learning about slavery as I mentioned before.
[ 2013-09-23 18:33:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | U | Today, in my discussion section, it was quite awkward, so much so that I got even more anxious about speaking.
[ 2013-09-23 18:34:16 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | U | I sat there mostly in dead silence as I had to be the token awkward African American male who is sensitive to this kind of nonsense.
[ 2013-09-23 18:34:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | U | I'm tired of learning about it.
[ 2013-09-23 18:34:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | U | Interestingly enough though, it makes me want to get out of South Carolina even more so because of Charleston's legacy as an internation slave port.
[ 2013-09-23 18:35:04 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | U | Over 90% of all slaves went through Charleston.
[ 2013-09-23 18:35:20 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | U | I mean, damn, I sick of learning about this stuff over and over every two years at least.
[ 2013-09-23 18:36:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | U | I don't hate history. I loved Irish History and World War II History with Dr. Hendrick. I just hate United States history (that's not taught by someone like Dr. Hendrick).<e_m ts="1379961362" a="jalen.benjamin" t="61"/>

[ 2013-09-24 23:21:58 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | wtf
[ 2013-09-24 23:22:14 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it's 3.60 for a whole gallon of milk (1.80 for a single drink at russell) and like a couple bucks for a loaf of bread and about 10 dollars or so for meat
[ 2013-09-24 23:22:21 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | for like a few pounds of meat

[ 2013-09-24 23:31:32 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and that's assuming you only eat 3 meals a day
[ 2013-09-24 23:31:41 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | cause you can come and go as many times as you want

[ 2013-09-25 00:08:24 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | personally i would guess something like v
[ 2013-09-25 00:08:25 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | but idk
[ 2013-09-25 00:08:39 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | it sounds like it lies on the xy plane but i could be completely wrong about that
[ 2013-09-25 00:08:41 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well the first 6 are the graphs you choose from
[ 2013-09-25 00:08:44 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | ah
[ 2013-09-25 00:08:46 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | well it appears

[ 2013-09-25 00:09:31 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | interesting
[ 2013-09-25 00:10:09 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | i picked C because when x and y are both 0, sin(xy) is 0.
[ 2013-09-25 00:10:22 ] Sender: Tyler Watt | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | and that's the only one i could tell is on 0 at that point
[ 2013-09-25 00:10:56 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | nice
[ 2013-09-25 00:10:58 ] Sender: Joshua Breece | Are you in that place beyond the sky? | sounds pretty logical

[ 2013-09-26 01:47:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Ah, good evening, sir.
[ 2013-09-26 01:59:04 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Hello JAlen
[ 2013-09-26 02:00:24 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Greetings.
[ 2013-09-26 02:00:36 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I came to an epiphany about a half an hour ago.
[ 2013-09-26 02:01:27 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | what kind?
[ 2013-09-26 02:02:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I've realized that most of the girls I've been chasing after are of the wrong type. I've said that before, but it struck me from a different perspective.
[ 2013-09-26 02:03:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I thought, &quot;What if the girls i'm truly attracted to are the ones I'm not that physically attracted to from first glance?&quot;
[ 2013-09-26 02:03:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Then, I thought back to my correlation theory that the more attractive a girl is, the more time guys give her attention, and the less time she spends doing the things you and I do.
[ 2013-09-26 02:03:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Then, it struck me again: my scale for women is not ideal.
[ 2013-09-26 02:04:32 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Instantly, I came up with a new nerd/geek scale in which I'm going to use to see how compatible women are.
[ 2013-09-26 02:05:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I'll give more weight to a score on that scale rather than my old one of overall attractibility.
[ 2013-09-26 02:05:50 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Lol nice
[ 2013-09-26 02:06:07 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | I kind of out of it today so sorry if I don't respond immediately
[ 2013-09-26 02:06:17 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | But your scale seems like a good one
[ 2013-09-26 02:06:30 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | I should probably incorporate it into my scale
[ 2013-09-26 02:06:58 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | But you made a good point
[ 2013-09-26 02:07:05 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | sad truth about women lol
[ 2013-09-26 02:08:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Interestingly enough, the new scale is still about attraction to a degree. However, I've made it so that if a girl satisfies these two conditions: 1. she is nerdy, alternative, introverted, or some type of social outcast that I'd like, etc., and 2. if she's a 6 or higher on the other scale.<e_m ts="1380161338" a="jalen.benjamin" t="61"/>
[ 2013-09-26 02:09:37 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | If she fits both, even at my most critical, in terms of compatibility, this girl is a 7 to 8.
[ 2013-09-26 02:10:00 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I suppose just a 7 if I need to be more specific.
[ 2013-09-26 02:10:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | An example of someone who wouldn't work would be Lisa Lynn. On this scale, I'd give her a 5.
[ 2013-09-26 02:11:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | At least 4 of those points come from her attractiveness alone.
[ 2013-09-26 02:12:53 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Had to make my conditions for the new scale a little more clear just now.
[ 2013-09-26 02:13:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | And while I say &quot;7 at my most critical,&quot; believe me, that might be rare.
[ 2013-09-26 02:13:55 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | 8s and 9s will be quite common.
[ 2013-09-26 02:14:20 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | thorough lol
[ 2013-09-26 02:15:03 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Well, I failed.
[ 2013-09-26 02:15:22 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | You're going to ask, &quot;How?&quot;<e_m ts="1380161722" a="jalen.benjamin" t="61"/>
[ 2013-09-26 02:15:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | XD
[ 2013-09-26 02:16:21 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | ya
[ 2013-09-26 02:16:51 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I'm talking to Lacie right now, and just like Half-Life 3, *it* has been confirmed.
[ 2013-09-26 02:17:01 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I'm not disappointed, though. I knew it.
[ 2013-09-26 02:18:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | This is quite the dilemma, though.
[ 2013-09-26 02:18:47 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | There aren't any girls at eSports, save three, but they all only play LoL.
[ 2013-09-26 02:18:59 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I wouldn't find common ground with them.
[ 2013-09-26 02:19:19 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | NASHI, the anime club, doesn't leave much time for socializing, either.
[ 2013-09-26 02:21:42 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Yeah. Sigh, the disappoint lately in our lives
[ 2013-09-26 02:21:43 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Fuck lol
[ 2013-09-26 02:22:54 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I'm going to make an attempt at student organizational work. It seems that if I'm going to find *her,* to even try, I need to lose some sleep.
[ 2013-09-26 02:24:33 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | The disappointment has gotten so bad that I have to lower my standards, and I need to.
[ 2013-09-26 02:24:42 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | It's been a very humbling process.
[ 2013-09-26 02:25:38 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Honestly, and I admit this in and of itself is a vice, even if a 5 sent me erotic photos like these girls I see on Reddit post on various threads, I'd be hard pressed to not want to be with her.<e_m ts="1380162338" a="jalen.benjamin" t="61"/>
[ 2013-09-26 02:26:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Most of my attractiveness scale is based on the face a lot anyway.<e_m ts="1380162394" a="jalen.benjamin" t="61"/>
[ 2013-09-26 02:27:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | It's not that difficult to find a girl who's anywhere from skinny to slightly curvy attractive.
[ 2013-09-26 02:27:23 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I love a woman's hips and her thighs as long as she's not overweight.
[ 2013-09-26 02:29:35 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | lol
[ 2013-09-26 02:29:42 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | true womanizer
[ 2013-09-26 02:30:26 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I don't think so. I am terrible, though.
[ 2013-09-26 02:30:50 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I realized that because I don't take care of my body as these 8s and above do at USC that I'm asking for too much.
[ 2013-09-26 02:31:41 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | And honestly, I'm attractive enough that I get people complementing on my voice as the server in Honeycomb Cafe (Honors cafeteria) did I got breakfast.
[ 2013-09-26 02:32:25 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Older, black and white women who themslelves are married and probably grandparents have told me that I was cute and stuff, so I feel it's not that anymore.
[ 2013-09-26 02:33:13 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | More honesty: if I got with a 6 (on my attractiveness scale) who was in a lot of ways like me, she'd probably think of me as high on her scale.
[ 2013-09-26 02:33:52 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I'm average height, I'm a nerd, and I'm black. There are some nerd girls out there that I don't consider who'd love to get a chance of me.
[ 2013-09-26 02:34:27 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | That's no bravado at all, and honestly, they deserve good looking men like us over a lot of these fraternity guys.
[ 2013-09-26 02:34:56 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Sure, I'm no Will Smith or Leonardo DiCaprio, but I think I'm good looking for a nerd.
[ 2013-09-26 02:35:34 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Lol.
[ 2013-09-26 02:36:13 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Yep. Better voice than I do.
[ 2013-09-26 02:36:35 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | You have a good speaking voice too in my opinion.
[ 2013-09-26 02:37:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | The sad part is that even if nerd girls wanted to get at me, they're not going to come out of their rooms, and they're not nearly as numerous over here at USC as they are at UC Berkeley.
[ 2013-09-26 02:38:07 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I hope I've learned my lesson now.
[ 2013-09-26 02:38:20 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | If eSports won't do it for me, what will?
[ 2013-09-26 02:40:10 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Something will come up hopefully
[ 2013-09-26 02:41:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Now granted, even I can't see myself going after 4s. Mental *and* physical attractiveness are my end goals.
[ 2013-09-26 02:41:18 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I'm sure the same will happen for you as well.
[ 2013-09-26 02:41:28 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I'd consider you to have better luck that I do now.
[ 2013-09-26 02:43:25 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Relatiely
[ 2013-09-26 02:43:49 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | hey, its fine though
[ 2013-09-26 02:45:08 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | What can I say? Sorority girls and a lot of scene, emo, and goth girls aren't compatibile with me anyway. In their own separate ways, they'd be too hardcore for me.
[ 2013-09-26 02:47:02 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | I've wanted to say this verse for a long time, and now when I remember to do it, it's at the most appropriate time:
[ 2013-09-26 02:47:05 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good with that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at
[ 2013-09-26 02:49:10 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | lol
[ 2013-09-26 02:50:56 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | That verse figuratively describes what types of girls I've been going after for most of my non-existent dating life, how I go after them, who I should go after, and how I blame the people I should go after.<e_m ts="1380163856" a="jalen.benjamin" t="61"/>
[ 2013-09-26 02:55:06 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Yeah. Good one.
[ 2013-09-26 03:05:55 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward |  I'm sorry Jalen. I just realized that was an awkward response
[ 2013-09-26 03:06:18 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | I really out of it if that is an excuse
[ 2013-09-26 03:06:51 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | I just some problems of my own right now.
[ 2013-09-26 03:08:57 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | It's fine, man. I understood what you said. Is there something on your mind?
[ 2013-09-26 03:10:11 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Yeah. To tell you the truth, one of the shittiest things happened to me today.
[ 2013-09-26 03:10:24 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | That would be the third day in a row
[ 2013-09-26 03:12:09 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Oh no...
[ 2013-09-26 03:12:16 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Do you mind telling me?
[ 2013-09-26 03:12:40 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | No i don't. I just need to eat a bit
[ 2013-09-26 03:12:43 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | I'll be back
[ 2013-09-26 03:13:34 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Okay.
[ 2013-09-26 03:56:58 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | Back
[ 2013-09-26 03:57:31 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Greetings.
[ 2013-09-26 03:58:33 ] Sent to: jalen.benjamin From Edward Kim | | Edward | So yeah.. Do you want to call?
[ 2013-09-26 03:58:54 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | That's fine, but I can only do until one at the latest.
[ 2013-09-26 03:58:58 ] Sender: Jalen Benjamin | | Edward | Let's do it.
